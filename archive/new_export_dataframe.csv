Client:,Cryptic, yes  we don t want our doctors looking mysterious  
Client:,Cryptic, i want this done by the end of the week  it s taking forever 
Me:,Cryptic, i m sorry  i didn t realize you wanted it done so soon  in our initial discussion about the job  you said there was 
Client:,Cryptic, to me  no huge rush  means  not today  
Me: ,Cryptic,i ve attached four different options for the cover page  please let me know which one you prefer so 
Client: ,Cryptic,yes  i like the images  
Me:,Cryptic, since we are on such a tight schedule  could you please be more precise when giving me feedback on this 
Client:,Cryptic, it needs to look a bit nicer  
Me:,Cryptic, can i get you to make me a visual palette of colors you d like  so i can have a better idea of what to work off of 
Client:,Cryptic, golden orangey  black like blue  purplish blue  berry purple  dusky gray purple

Client:,Cryptic, we want black  we just want the black to be less black  like half 
Client: ,Cryptic, we want something like a ghost with a martini 
Client: ,Cryptic,we want a ghost with a martini  but we don t want there to be alcohol because this is a kid friendly event  and we don t want there to be a ghost because that s too scary  but 
Client:,Cryptic, i like the layout  but can you dial up the cool factor 
Me:,Cryptic, can you 
Client:,Cryptic, i don t know  just make it cooler  but don t change it too much   my boss has already approved it 
Me:,Cryptic, i m not sure how to help   can you give me some guidance 
Client:,Cryptic, yes  just dial up the cool factor 
Client:,Cryptic, i want something original and unique  you know  something never seen before 
Client:,Cryptic, what is this 
Me:,Cryptic, you said you 
Client: ,Cryptic,yeah  but i meant something everybody would recognize  couldn t you just use an existing design or template 
Client:,Cryptic, i don t like the designs you ve sent over  please change them 
Me:,Cryptic, what do you not like about them specifically  
Client:,Cryptic, please refer to my email from monday  i don t have time at the moment 
Client:,Cryptic, hi  i don t like this design   please change it 
Me:,Cryptic, okay  so we want larger thumbnails  do you want two or three thumbnails per row 
Client:,Cryptic, how about somewhere between   and   
Client:,Cryptic, i need a profile image for my website 
Me:,Cryptic, no problem  what are the dimensions 
Client:,Cryptic, square with a little bit rectangle 
Client:,Cryptic, take the prices off of each item 
Me:,Cryptic, how will people know how much each item costs 
Client:,Cryptic, i don t want the prices to be the 
Me:,Cryptic, isn t this an online store where people can purchase your products 
Client:,Cryptic, no  it s a gallery where people can purchase my products 
Me:,Cryptic, without knowing the price 
Client:,Cryptic, yes  also change the header from  gallery  to  shop  
Me:,Cryptic, would you like this poster designed in landscape or portrait orientation 
Client:,Cryptic, yes 
Me:,Cryptic, okay  let me take a look 
Me:,Cryptic, you said page three  correct 
Client:,Cryptic, yes  there are too many widows  i can t stand widows  you need to fix them 
Me:,Cryptic, i m sorry  but 
Client:,Cryptic, too  many  widows 
Me:,Cryptic, it s just that i just don t see any 
Client:,Cryptic, at the end of line    and line    and line    and line     they re there 
Me:,Cryptic, oh  you mean the hyphens 
Client:,Cryptic, hyphens  widows  
Client:,Cryptic, in the first proof you sent me  the blue is too dark  now it s too light 
Me:,Cryptic, do you have a 
Client:,Cryptic, the blue needs to be the colour of the sky on a beach in turkey 
Client: ,Cryptic,i need you to draw a picture for me 
Me: ,Cryptic,okay  what will this picture be of 
Client: ,Cryptic,do you know the chinese cherry blossom flower 
Me: ,Cryptic,yes  
Client: ,Cryptic,i want you to draw it for me 
Me: ,Cryptic,can you be more specific  as a logo  a header  a specific design 
Client: ,Cryptic,i want you to draw a chinese cherry blossom flower for me 
Me:,Cryptic, i m sorry to hear that the committee doesn t find the logo designs inspiring  i wonder if you could give me some more guidance  all i have for feedback is that  they need more oomph  
Client:,Cryptic, well  they re just a little plain  can t you add a knife and fork  or maybe a wheat sheaf  the group felt they need 
Client:,Cryptic, the presentation looks great   just a couple of fixes  can you make the slide titles follow  example  format  and make the plot axis labels bigger 
Me:,Cryptic, sure 
Client:,Cryptic, that s much better   can you add slide numbers 
Me:,Cryptic, yep   
Client:,Cryptic, yeah  that s looking great   can you change the colors on the plots to  example  
Me:,Cryptic, no problem 
Client:,Cryptic, okay  great  yeah  it s looking really good   just needs a little touching up and it ll be ready to go 
Me:,Cryptic, sure  what does it need 
Client:,Cryptic,  well  i guess it s fine  it ll be okay 
Me:,Cryptic, i ll make any changes you want done  what is looking unfinished to you 
Client:,Cryptic, no  it s okay  i guess it ll work 
Me:,Cryptic, are you sure   i ll be happy to change anything you d like before we put it out 
Client:,Cryptic, no  just go ahead and submit it as is  once you ve finished 
Client:,Cryptic, i need you to 
Me:,Cryptic, this hand is actually extremely warm  it doesn t match the rest of the skin   i ll balance it out 
Client:,Cryptic, i said it was too cold   warm it up 
Client:,Cryptic, why is it more red   i said to warm it up 
Me:,Cryptic, usually  more red and yellow means warmer  while more blue and cyan means colder 
Client:,Cryptic, i meant that the model s hand was cold in the studio  look how red it looks  that s because it was too cold in there that day 
Me:,Cryptic, so i ll just  warm it up  by making it look cooler 
Client:,Cryptic, yeah  that s great  why was that so hard   didn t they teach you this in art school 
Client:,Cryptic,     we don t like your writing  it s too ballsy  braggy and makes us look like we are too full of ourselves 
Client:,Cryptic,      yeah  yeah  tone it down  you make us seem as if we show off  be subtle 
Me:,Cryptic, ok  i m hearing you  let me know what you want me to point out about your motorbikes  
Client:,Cryptic,     well  we invented the category  now we reinvented it again  as we always do when we launch a new product  there s literally no one close to our product s standard  it s unparalleled  there s no terrain or turf worldwide that our bikes can t handle  they re the ultimate in any and all aspects  basically  every part is new  redesigned  or both 
Client:,Cryptic,     be sure to repeat all this  
Client:,Cryptic,     but this time be subtle 
Client:,Cryptic, i feel like the current design you did is great  but it s not serious enough  thoughts 
Me: ,Cryptic,can you be more specific on what do you mean by not serious enough  
Client:,Cryptic, i m not sure how to elaborate  something more corporate  maybe 
Me: ,Cryptic,that helps  but  corporate  doesn t give a clear idea on what or how you would like the design to be  if you are not sure how to explain what needs to change  perhaps you could give me an example or reference 
Client: ,Cryptic,if i have to 
Client:,Cryptic, we market tested your dialogue and the testers didn t like it  can you 
Me: ,Cryptic,what didn t they like about it 
Client:,Cryptic, they just didn t laugh  please fix it and have it to me by tomorrow 
Client:,Cryptic, we need you to design an app for our company   something that will put our logo on people s phones 
Me:,Cryptic, okay  what would you like the app to do 
Client:,Cryptic, keep me from losing my job 
Me:,Cryptic, here are some logo samples 
Client:,Cryptic, reallly    
Me:,Cryptic, i m not sure what you mean by really  are you asking if they re there  or is there something you specific about the mock ups you don t like  such as fonts  color  or overall design 
Client:,Cryptic, if i have to 
Client:,Cryptic, this is okay  but i want to see it in a simpler  bolder font and without the gradient on the cover  in addition to a few other very specific changes  
Me:,Cryptic, no problem  i ll send the revised files tomorrow 
Client:,Cryptic, i don t like 
Me:,Cryptic, i m sorry  i thought i implemented all your changes  what would you like to see instead 
Client:,Cryptic, you re the designer  you should be creative and not take what i say so literally  you should push back if you think something else will work better  
Me:,Cryptic,  ggmmhrpphh  okay  sure  i ll send some new ideas over  
Client:,Cryptic, i really don t like this  you re not listening  i don t understand why you didn t just do what i asked you to do the first time 
Client:,Cryptic, can you make it wider 
Me:,Cryptic, we can t make it wider without making the text column next to it narrower 
Client:,Cryptic, not side to side wider  up and down wider 
Client: ,Cryptic,i m excited about the new pictures  when are you free to do them 
Me: ,Cryptic,i have  these dates and times  open  when s best for you  i ll need you there to prepare the food for the shoot 
Client: ,Cryptic, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post            i told a client i would be out of the town for  asap  a

Me:,Cryptic, can the layout of the pdf change over time 
Client:,Cryptic, no  it will stay the same  
Me:,Cryptic, i was thinking  we can make this image with their logo and our link at the bottom  what do you think 
Client:,Cryptic, good 
Client:,Cryptic, who approved this  do you have any idea of how serious this is  we could get penalized through corporate communications  we can t use logos  we can t produce media like this 
Client:,Cryptic,  good   is not an approval    good   is   
Client: ,Cryptic,the crash is better 
Me:,Cryptic, i m sorry  do you mean that the crash no longer occurs  or that it occurs more often 
Client:,Cryptic, 
Client:,Cryptic, 
Me:,Cryptic, alright  send me the information and i ll see what i can do 
Client:,Cryptic, i just did 
Me:,Cryptic, where did you send it  i don t see

Me:,Cryptic, not really  can you please 
Client:,Cryptic, let me put that another way  i wanted a  wow   you gave me a wow   is that so hard to understand 
Me:,Cryptic, is that really putting it another way

Me:,Cryptic, well  yes   those are the roughs  if you like any of them  we can finish them up 
Client:,Cryptic, they all look like they need to be finished

Client:,Cryptic, i don t know what you aren t getting  these all look unfinished  
Client:,Cryptic, i need you to change the doorbell 
Me:,Cryptic, what seems to be the problem with it 
Client:,Cryptic, it s the wrong kind of doorbell 
Me:,Cryptic, what is the right kind of doorbell 
Client:,Cryptic, one that goes ding 
Me:,Cryptic, does this one not ding 
Client:,Cryptic, it dings  but it s the wrong kind of ding   i need it to go ding 
Me:,Cryptic, you need it to go ding  but not ding

Client:,Cryptic, i don t know  like  different  maybe you could try out something 
Client:,Cryptic, can you make the black look more white 
Me:,Cryptic, you mean 
Client:,Cryptic, no  i want the black to look more white 
Me: ,Cryptic,i finished the design for the booklet s front and back cover  is there anything you want me to change 
Client:,Cryptic, it needs to be 
Me: ,Cryptic,what do you mean by that  i need some specifics  colours  shapes or fonts  what am i changing 
Client: ,Cryptic,you re the professional 
Me: ,Cryptic,hey  i m trying to get your logo set up for embroidery  but i am missing some information  the notes say that the emblem should be hunter green and gold  but i need to know 
Client:,Cryptic, gold thread is fine 
Me:,Cryptic, would you like to make box terminology constant and have value  or just have them interchangeable  or only use one or the other 
Client:,Cryptic, yes  
Client:,Cryptic, could you do anything about the background  it looks too old 
Me:,Cryptic, you mean the broken down abandoned house you took pictures in 
Client:,Cryptic, yea  could you make it look newer  the peeling paint and plant covered bricks are a little too much for me 
Me:,Cryptic, so you want the house to look modern 
Client: ,Cryptic,or futuristic  or both 
Client: ,Cryptic, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post            me can you send me what youre looking at via  what color is that   a

Client:,Cryptic, well  
Me:,Cryptic, meaning

Me:,Cryptic, ah  
Client:,Cryptic, this is exactly what we need  great job  just one more thing though  you know 
Me:,Cryptic, i m sorry  what 
Client: ,Cryptic,jumping  you know  a lot of websites have their links jumping  it s the best way to showcase our links 
Me:,Cryptic, you mean they re animated 
Client:,Cryptic, no  this is formal 
Me:,Cryptic, i still don t understand 
Client:,Cryptic, i am looking for a fine lettering to embroider onto clothes  so it has to be big enough to embroider and read  but thin  to keep it subtle  here is what i have in mind 
Client:,Cryptic, this is sporty  this is nautical   this may even be spacecrafty and futuristic  can you find 
Me:,Cryptic, 
Client:,Cryptic, what it says there 
Me:,Cryptic, i see what it says  but i don t understand what you mean 
Client:,Cryptic, look  what should i put there 
Me:,Cryptic, well  i can t tell you what to put there until i know what you re trying to say
Client:,Cryptic, it s a description of the smell of a banana   can t you just tell me what should i put there 
Me:,Cryptic, but your description is  a banana has a smell like a strong scent of the smell  
Client:,Cryptic, i don t see the problem  is there something wrong with the grammar 
Client: ,Cryptic,the screenshot with the alphabetical  search  and about menu   i like those   
Me:,Cryptic, great 
Client: ,Cryptic,sort of 
Me:,Cryptic, oh 
Client: ,Cryptic,i know they could look much better 
Me:,Cryptic, how so 
Client: ,Cryptic,by doing them better  
Me:,Cryptic, but 
Client: ,Cryptic,i m looking for a significant improvement 
Client: ,Cryptic,i want you to create something similar  but different 
Me:,Cryptic, do you know what you would like to keep the same 
Client: ,Cryptic,the good parts  
Me:,Cryptic, which are  
Client: ,Cryptic, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post             could you make all of the arrows go to the right  i would think  a 
Me:,Cryptic, er  okay  well  can you tell me what you don t like 
Client: ,Cryptic,no  i want to be constructive with my criticism  
Me:,Cryptic, and what s your criticism  exactly 
Client: ,Cryptic,it should be the same  but different  
Me:,Cryptic, i m not sure that s a criticism  
Client: ,Cryptic,are you criticizing my criticism 
Client:,Cryptic, can you give me a 
Me:,Cryptic, yeah  sure  what size do you need it 
Client:,Cryptic, err  about half a monitor 
Client:,Cryptic, i need an ad created for a magazine spread we re doing 
Me:,Cryptic, okay  what size ad do you need 
Client:,Cryptic, full page 
Me:,Cryptic, 
Client:,Cryptic, um  just make it full page and they can crop it if they need to 
Me:,Cryptic, we ll come back to that  what do want the ad to say 
Client:,Cryptic, no idea 
Me:,Cryptic, do you have any direction for me 
Client:,Cryptic, make it kickass 
Me:,Cryptic,  and what size is this image supposed to be 
Client:,Cryptic, medium 
Client:,Cryptic, this is some great stuff  i can t decide 
Me:,Cryptic, i personally think the last one is the best  when you decide which graphic you prefer let me know so i can gather the images i need and build it 
Client:,Cryptic, this isn t the graphic i wanted  where s the other one 
Me:,Cryptic, you never told me which graphic you liked and i thought the deadline couldn t be pushed back 
Client:,Cryptic, i wanted the other one 
Me:,Cryptic, what other one  i made four different versions 
Client:,Cryptic, the one before this one 
Me:,Cryptic, there were three 
Client:,Cryptic, yes  one of those 
Client:,Cryptic, i have a potential gig for you 
Me:,Cryptic, great  what is it 
Client:,Cryptic, i have a customer who is using  equipment brand i specialize in  and he needs some new programming  can you let me know about how much you d charge 
Me:,Cryptic, sure  get me drawings of their system or a list of the equipment they re using and let me know what kind of content they are looking for and i ll get you a quote 
Client:,Cryptic, oh  well we don t really know what kind of equipment they have or how it s laid out 
Me:,Cryptic, okay then  can you tell me what kind of content they are looking for 
Client:,Cryptic, well we can t determine what content they ll need until we know what equipment they have  can you 
Me:,Cryptic, not until i have something to determine how long it ll take  
Client:,Cryptic, can you put some cool reds in there 
Me:,Cryptic, red is usually considered very warm 
Me:,Cryptic, any colour can be cool  
Me,Cryptic,  so  we should implement this using a technology due to b reasons  and how do you feel about c  the upside is d  or we could go with e  also  i need your input on f before i can complete this part of the project  finally  there s g to consider  you mentioned this in passing  but i wanted to get more specific details 
Client: ,Cryptic, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post             i had a client who wanted me to illustrate  yes   a 
Client:,Cryptic, i want you to 
Me:,Cryptic, okay  shoot 
Client:,Cryptic, we need a simple and artistic logo  
Me:,Cryptic, what do you mean by artistic 
Client:,Cryptic, something fancy  
Me:,Cryptic, so fancy and simple 
Client:,Cryptic, that s a bit of an oxymoron  isn t it 
Me:,Cryptic, yeah  which is why i asked for clarification 
Client:,Cryptic, right  so be artistic about it  
Client:,Cryptic, i don t like it 
Me:,Cryptic, could you 
Client:,Cryptic, change it 
Me:,Cryptic, what do you want me to change 
Client:,Cryptic, change it to something i would like  
Client: ,Cryptic,i don t want to 
Me:,Cryptic,so  put that in the newsletter 
Client:,Cryptic, exactly  then we can have it link to the information on the website 
Me:,Cryptic, i m sorry  where were we putting the information again 
Me:,Cryptic, how do you see this coming on 
Client:,Cryptic, 
Me:,Cryptic, like how 
Client:,Cryptic, like this 
Me:,Cryptic, right  i ll try working with that 
Client:,Cryptic, no  that s not right at all  it needs to look more like this 
Me:,Cryptic, i don t understand what you re saying  i need you to explain what you want using words 
Client:,Cryptic, it s simple  you just need to animate it 
Client:,Cryptic, like 
Client:,Cryptic, this 
Client:,Cryptic, 
Me: ,Cryptic,is that  b  for  bravo  
Client: ,Cryptic,what   no   b   like for  berty  
Me:,Cryptic, 
Client:,Cryptic,     what do you think 
Client: ,Cryptic,    hmmm  not sure how to describe it 
Client: ,Cryptic,    yeah  you the know the strip of light you get between red and orange  you know  that ghost like specter  that dusty colour above the white and blue of a sunset  
Client: ,Cryptic,    yes  exactly 
Me:,Cryptic, you mean yellow 
Client:,Cryptic,         yeah  yellow  
Client:,Cryptic, the colour is too dark  can you make it brighter 
Client:,Cryptic, we asked you to change the colour  not just make it brighter  see previous notes 
Client: ,Cryptic,hey  can you send me over a quote for some banners  please 
Me:,Cryptic, sure  can you let me know size  material  and quantity so i can work out your costs 
Client:,Cryptic,  small  medium  and large 
Client:,Cryptic, is there any way for our logo to be better represented 
Me:,Cryptic, i m not sure what you re looking for in terms of signage  can you be more specific 
Client:,Cryptic, just make it so the other logo underneath ours is a little more  logo ie  
Me:,Cryptic, you want us to change another company s logo 
Client: ,Cryptic,don t change it  just make it look better next to ours 
Me:,Cryptic, how 
Client: ,Cryptic,by making it more  logo ie   
Client: ,Cryptic,great  i like the website design you made  but can you make it nicer 
Me:,Cryptic, what do you mean 
Client: ,Cryptic,i mean  with nicer colors or shapes 
Me:,Cryptic, 
Client: ,Cryptic,something like what you did  but a bit more nice  
Me:,Cryptic, i m sorry  that doesn t quite make sense  
Client: ,Cryptic,i know  it should be  like what you did  but nicer   but you asked for me to make things clearer 
Client: ,Cryptic,can you do some concepts just like that image i sent  
Me:,Cryptic, depends what kind of  different  you want 
Client: ,Cryptic,the same concept idea  but completely different 
Me:,Cryptic, i m still not sure what parts need to be different 
Client: ,Cryptic,all of them 
Me:,Cryptic, then what s the same 
Client: ,Cryptic,nothing 
Me:,Cryptic, then what s the point of the image you sent 
Client: ,Cryptic,it s something to build on 
Me:,Cryptic, so you want that as a foundation  but a foundation that i in no way use 
Client: ,Cryptic,exactly 
Client: ,Cryptic,i don t love the visual at the beginning of this video  i would love to replace it with news station film or school bus with kids getting off 
Me:,Cryptic, i haven t seen the footage you are referencing  could you send it to me 
Client: ,Cryptic,agreed  
Me:,Cryptic, 
Client: ,Cryptic,we don t have other footage  i m saying in the future 
Me:,Cryptic, we ll get the footage in the future 
Client: ,Cryptic,god no  there s no time for that  
Client:,Cryptic, can you design a commemorative tattoo of my mom  she s dying of cancer 
Me:,Cryptic, sure  
Client:,Cryptic, russian 
Me:,Cryptic, what does that mean  do you have a photo  or any idea  
Client:,Cryptic, it means she looks nothing like me   but can you make it sorta like me 
CLIENT:,Cryptic, hi   arg  mdl is tomz   pm 
Client:,Cryptic, is it possible to make the black and white photo more colourful 
Me:,Cryptic, sure  i ll change it right away 
Client:,Cryptic, no  no no  i need the picture to be black and white  but 
Client:,Cryptic, could we change the eyes 
Me:,Cryptic, okay  did you have something in mind 
Client:,Cryptic, yes  i want him to have eyes like herbie s 
Me:,Cryptic, herbie  like  the car 
Client:,Cryptic, yes  that s it 
Me:,Cryptic, but  herbie s a car  he doesn t have eyes   just headlights  
Client:,Cryptic, yes  that s right  
Client:,Cryptic, that looks terrible  can you make it look right 
Me:,Cryptic, sure  can you explain what doesn t look  right  to you 
Client:,Cryptic, ugh  
Client:,Cryptic, i love it  
Me:,Cryptic, great  which one would you like to use 
Client:,Cryptic, definitely the blue one 
Me:,Cryptic, but  they re all blue  
Client:,Cryptic, yeah  but i mean 
Client:,Cryptic, hey there  i just wanted to let you know  my boss loves the new logo  and we got your invoice and everything  but my boss wants you to make some changes on the invoice 
Me:,Cryptic, okay   did i get the company info wrong 
Client:,Cryptic, no  not that  he wants you to change the payment amount 
Me:,Cryptic, absolutely not  we settled on the price before going into this  and everyone approved of the logo design  and 
Client:,Cryptic, oh  sorry  you see  my boss was so impressed with your design that he actually wants to pay you more than we agreed 
Me:,Cryptic,  what 
Client:,Cryptic, so he wanted to know if you could update your invoice for our records  just double the amount you have listed 
Me:,Cryptic, uh  okay  
Client:,Cryptic, that isn t going to be a problem for you  is it 
Me:,Cryptic, no  of course not  not at all  i ll get that updated invoice to you right away  
Client:,Cryptic, i need you to fix the width of the menu block of the website  it 
Me:,Cryptic, width  i checked the psd file you sent me and is exactly the same width is shown
Client:,Cryptic, look  i need you to fix this menu  it looks too wide 
Me:,Cryptic, ma am  i double checked the width of the menu and is exactly as is necessitated in the psd document
Client:,Cryptic, it s still too wide  i don t care what you say  the distance from top to bottom is too wide  
Me:,Cryptic, is there a particular  feel  you want your website to have  for example  do you want it to 
Client:,Cryptic, yes   integration  optimization  results  return  media investment 
Me:,Cryptic, 
Client:,Cryptic, the one you submitted to us 
Me:,Cryptic, hi  sorry to contact you again  but i was hoping to get the images to add to the creative in order to send it your way for approval prior to deadline 
Client: ,Cryptic,unfortunately  we cannot 
Me:,Cryptic, oh  i was under the impression that you would need those images in the creative in order to approve it 
Client:,Cryptic, yes  that is correct 
Me:,Cryptic, roughly how big is the item 
Client:,Cryptic, about the size of a box  
Me:,Cryptic, the articles supplied by the vet association are password protected  i can t simply copy the text out of them  they have to be re typed  i have someone who does that sort of thing  she s fast  accurate and inexpensive  
Client: ,Cryptic,sure
Me:,Cryptic, ha ha  that was an  either or  question  not sure which option you re agreeing to 
Client:,Cryptic, both
Me:,Cryptic, these events you do  when do they happen  are they inside of outside  are they for large groups  or smaller groups  do they take place in an office  a rented place  or someone s home 
Client:,Cryptic, 
Me,Homophobes,  what feeling or message do you want your logo to convey to those who view it 
Client,Homophobes,  loud and proud  just 
Me:,Homophobes, so here is my quote for the cocktail gown that we discussed last week 
Client:,Homophobes, thanks  i understand the lines for fabric and other material  but what is the last line about 
Me:,Homophobes, that s for my design work and the time necessary to stitch and build the gown 
Client:,Homophobes, i don t understand  how does that account for that sum of money 
Me:,Homophobes, based on our initial conversation and preliminary design  i estimated x hours of work 
Client:,Homophobes, you charge money for drawing designs 
Me:,Homophobes, yes 
Client:,Homophobes, i don t get it  
Client: ,Homophobes, and yes  my business is too important to me to discuss it in some  nasty  noisy  public  coffee shop

Client:,Homophobes, i don t get it  
Client: ,Homophobes, and yes  my business is too important to me to discuss it in some  nasty  noisy  public  coffee shop  
Client:,Homophobes, i want a mascot that appeals to both male and female viewers 
Client:,Homophobes,    obviously  she s too fat  can you make her look like a blonde wonder woman 
Client:,Homophobes, make her breasts bigger too  and let s make those daisy dukes  and we ll have her holding a shotgun 
Client: ,Homophobes, i don t know  do you think ending with the checkered flag is too gay 
Me: ,Homophobes,um 
Client: ,Homophobes,i mean  
Me:,Homophobes, i don t think it s too gay 
Client: ,Homophobes,but it s the obvious choice  right  despite being gay 
Me: ,Homophobes,i 
Client: ,Homophobes,not that i have anything against gay people  wait  you re not gay  are you  i guess you d know best if you are  
Client:,Homophobes, i don t know  i don t really want to bring this up 
Me:,Homophobes, what  
Client:,Homophobes, well  there s just something about two guys standing at a bank counter 
Me:,Homophobes, what 
Client:,Homophobes, 
Me:,Homophobes, two guys standing at a bank counter seems gay to you 
Client:,Homophobes, yeah  
Me:,Homophobes, i don t see that 
Client:,Homophobes, well
Client:,Homophobes, i don t know  none of these concepts say breast cancer to me 
Me:,Homophobes, what do you mean 
Client:,Homophobes, well there s nothing in them that lets me know that they re ads for breast cancer  so they all seem pretty vague 
Me:,Homophobes, well the headline says the treatment is for breast cancer   are you not satisfied with the images 
Client:,Homophobes, yeah   like  there are no breasts in the concept   and there s nothing pink 
Me: ,Homophobes,is that really necessary for a breast cancer campaign 
Client: ,Homophobes,oh no 
Me: ,Homophobes,then  
Client: ,Homophobes,but it is necessary for 
Client:,Homophobes, i don t like this leprechaun  he s too scary  he should look less like a fictional character and more like the people that use our product 
Client: ,Homophobes,do fairies have acorns for hats  that seems a little far fetched  and this one has different wings  why are they different  
Client:,Homophobes, here s the concept for the new logo we need 
Me:,Homophobes, 
Client:,Homophobes, i don t know  flowers or something 
Me:,Homophobes, any preferences on font or color 
Client:,Homophobes, i don t know  look  if i tell you anymore than i ve already told you  i ll be doing all the work 
Client:,Homophobes,     i don t know  there s something missing 
Client:,Homophobes,     yeah  it s too  girly  
Client:,Homophobes,      hey wait  let s add purple  can you add purple to it  
Clients:,Homophobes,     yes  it s perfect  it definitely needed the purple 
Me:,Homophobes, should i take out one of the other colors 
Client:,Homophobes,     no  no  it s great the way it is  thanks 
Client: ,Homophobes,    glad we caught that fruity look before it got out of hand  
Client: ,Homophobes,    totally  
Client:,Homophobes, so  the gays are pretty popular now  huh 
Me:,Homophobes, homosexuality is more widely accepted  yeah 
Client:,Homophobes, ok  i need you to 
*Editor’s note:,Homophobes, i censored some of the language  my apologies for having illicit language appear in our subscribers feed   
Client:,Ingrates, we are going to focus around programmes and students who attend them  use that language 
Client:,Ingrates, mmm   we don t like the name  programmes   make it  cohorts  
Me:,Ingrates, but we already have all the models  relations  api routes  mobile app that uses these routes  tables  constants named with programme in mind  it s going to be a huge task to change all that now 
Client:,Ingrates, yep  still  make it cohorts 
Me:,Ingrates,  ok  fine 
Client:,Ingrates, we ve decided against calling them  cohorts   change everything back to  programme  
Me:,Ingrates,  considering violence  whether self  or otherwise  
Client: ,Ingrates,why is this an earlier version  fix it 
Client:,Ingrates, hi  i m  name  s assistant and i m looking to order a commission for one of their friends as a christmas gift  what are your turnaround times like 
Me:,Ingrates, my work usually takes a few weeks to complete and i m currently booked up for the next several months  i m also afraid that the postage deadline for guaranteed christmas delivery was last week  let me know if you d still be interested in booking  and i m happy to answer any questions you might have 
Client: ,Ingrates,you re sure you can t turn it around by christmas for  name  
Me: ,Ingrates,   quite 
Client: ,Ingrates,we just forwarded you the new design process package  design review will now occur at     and will require a     drawing set submitted for review  you are expected to have     of the design completed without any major feedback from the brand and complete the same round of revisions that you would at     
Client: ,Ingrates,we ve decided to go in a different direction 
Client: ,Ingrates,i was going to shoot this on my phone but i couldn t record my voice at the same time 
Me:,Ingrates, so  what is happening  are problems arising during the sprint  the client is frustrated with the delays  and i need to know if you need some support or renegotiate something 
Me:,Ingrates, how are you and your colleague dividing the time 
Client: ,Ingrates,the website has become a problem  now it s causing problems with google analytics and seo for some people who are obsessed with that silly shit 
Client: ,Ingrates,can you use that  
Me:,Ingrates, not really  and  as i stated when i agreed to this project  because of the tight deadline i don t have the time to create new concepts  normally i would be willing  but i need you to pick from the concepts i sent you  
Client:,Ingrates, can t you use what i sent you 
Me:,Ingrates, ok  based on what you re saying you like i think then my second option i gave you would work best for what you want  i am concerned about being able to finish your ad on time if i don t spend all of my allotted time today on getting the actual draft done rather than finishing your layout 
Client:,Ingrates, okay  but could you  change one aspect of that layout that would ruin the entire composition  
Client:,Ingrates, here s a list of    things that need to be done by 
Me:,Ingrates, i ve checked the requirements and our schedule and i m pleased to say we can have these ready for you in time 
Client:,Ingrates, sure is  let me know when these are ready for review 
Me:,Ingrates, changes are complete  we can deploy with your approval 
Me:,Ingrates, this is quite a substantial amount of work  even with overtime  the earliest this could be delivered is the following wednesday 
Client:,Ingrates, i can t believe you would let us down like this  i don t care how you do it  these must be done for this wednesday  even if you and the whole team have to work days and nights  fix your mistake and get it done 
Me:,Ingrates, so    do we go home 
Boss: ,Ingrates,no  keep working  you have a phone  use your data 
Me: ,Ingrates,   will you reimburse me for my data 
Boss: ,Ingrates,just get to work

Me:,Ingrates, here s the second version 
Client: ,Ingrates,not bad  but it s missing this feature 
Me: ,Ingrates,that feature was on the first version  and i confirmed with you that you wanted it removed 
Client: ,Ingrates,i didn t agree to that 
Me: ,Ingrates,   
Client:,Ingrates, what  are you some kind of scammer  i will call the cops if you try to rip me off  
Client:,Ingrates, what is the status 
Me:,Ingrates, i have not started yet

Me: ,Ingrates,still waiting for that stuff 
Client:,Ingrates, shoot  right  here it is  
Me: ,Ingrates,thanks  just so you know i ve had a lot of things come up this week so i can t get on this right now  
Client:,Ingrates, you promised me you d have it done in ten days  
Me:,Ingrates, how can i finish it in ten days if it takes you thirteen to send me important information  tell you what  i can squeeze this work in tomorrow  i ll get it done then  i promise  
Client: ,Ingrates,fine 
Me: ,Ingrates,hey  i just looked at what you sent me and a lot of the information is wrong or out of date  can you send me an updated version  
Client:,Ingrates, ok  i am busy right now and will check them in the evening  i hope this won t affect our deadline today 
Me:,Ingrates,    
Client:,Ingrates, i need this in two months  is it possible to get this edited for then 
Me:,Ingrates, yeah no problem  that s plenty of time  i ll get started on it later this week and should only take two days to edit  i m working on a project now but let s schedule a meeting for tuesday to go over all the details  
Me:,Ingrates, hey  are we okay to reschedule that meeting to wednesday morning  i have an emergency on another shoot 
Client:,Ingrates, yes of course no problem 
Client:,Ingrates, okay i want my deposit back right now you haven t even downloaded the footage i sent you 
Me:,Ingrates, i m sorry i don t fully understand  we were having a meeting today to go over the details so i could begin the editing process 
Client:,Ingrates, you are a waste of time  send me back the footage and give me my money back 
Client: ,Ingrates,your job will be to design promotion stuff and prep clients  designs from file to production   
Me: ,Ingrates,that s a lot of stuff to do  i don t think i ll be able to handle all that 
Client: ,Ingrates,it s in your job description  
Client: ,Ingrates,you re giving up so easily  you have no ambition to succeed  
Client: ,Ingrates,just stay for another month  
Me:,Ingrates, this video will take about   week to edit but it could take longer as it s quite complicated 
Client:,Ingrates, okay  that s fine 
Client:,Ingrates, how long until the video is done we re growing impatient 
"Me,",Ingrates, 
in my brain:,Ingrates, why even bother pretending you understand the time scale then gahhhhhhhhhh
Me:,Ingrates, ok  i brought my microphone  computer  and headphones  let s get started 
Client:,Ingrates, thanks  this should be easy 
Me:,Ingrates, sounds like we re almost done 
Client:,Ingrates, right   with the first page 
Me:,Ingrates, ummmm  what 
Client:,Ingrates, now we can really get serious 
Me:,Ingrates,    right 
Client: ,Ingrates,hope you don t mind a bit of pressure  people cry at work here a lot 
Client: ,Ingrates,we like your designs  we ll get back to you soon  
Me:,Ingrates, hi  i would love to  however  i m going to be out of town visiting my family  the trip has been planned for a while  but i d be happy to do a project over the weekend or come in on monday  
Me:,Ingrates, well  that would cost me a lot of money  but let me see what i can do 
Client:,Ingrates, hi  we ve agreed that it s ok for you to do this project for us while you are out of town  you have to submit this no later than thursday for us to make a decision by friday  there is a huge hackathon event happening and you have to create   different designs for merch for company a  b  c  and d
Manager: ,Ingrates,how s it going on the reports  you saw the examples of how i want them to look  right 
Me:,Ingrates, these reports are more detailed than i thought they would be  but i m making progress 
Manager:,Ingrates, how long is it taking you to create each report 
Me:,Ingrates, an hour and a half for each report 
Manager:,Ingrates, it should only take you    minutes 
Me:,Ingrates, how many clients do you currently have  and what are their needs 
Client:,Ingrates, we have about    clients with different requirements and goals  we don t stick to one niche 
Me:,Ingrates, and i would be managing the project communications and tracking project status for all of these clients 
Client:,Ingrates, yes
Client:,Ingrates, we need someone to improve the seo for this business  we have worked on the website  but we still have a long way to go  what would you do to improve the seo 
Me:,Ingrates, there are lots of factors that impact seo  i would look at adding more quality website content  working on the imagery  improving page titles and meta descriptions  and improving the overall design and ux of the sites 
Client:,Ingrates, i see  yeah  we need to improve all those things 
Client:,Ingrates, well  we ll let you know if we want to bring you on board  if 
Me: ,Ingrates,i m open to it  but in my experience  you need to do more than just post on instagram and google ads  you need to update the website  work on your seo  up your online presence and more  
Client:,Ingrates, i just need these two things  
Me: ,Ingrates,this is all in line with what i said before  i think to see results  you need to raise the budget for google ads  update your business listings and work on the seo of your website  we should probably be trying other social media platforms as well  
Client:,Ingrates, this is really quite urgent  so we d appreciate a swift response  we ve had two other designers let us down recently  so we re really behind schedule 
Client:,Ingrates, we love your ideas  we need to discuss them internally  then we ll be in touch  brilliant work 
Me:,Ingrates, just following up on the proposal as i m aware the deadline is fast approaching  if you could let me know  that would be great 
Client:,Ingrates, hi  we re still keen to have you on board  are you available  let me know asap 
Me:,Ingrates, yes  i have limited availability this month   please let me know what you need 
Me:,Ingrates, this is just a test model  we re making reliefs  right  the bugs in the relief will be attached right to the rest of the piece  i ll make the background first as a flat layer  then add  d bugs and plants so you can photograph it 
Client:,Ingrates, no  we ll use this bee  is it ready to photograph 
Me:,Ingrates,    no  i need to make the entire clay illustration  you want these made from ceramic  right  it ll be much faster and better quality if i work in my own studio with my own materials 
Client:,Ingrates, can you just bring the clay here 
Me:,Ingrates, it s a different clay  it needs to be put through the kiln  i m honestly not familiar with sculpy and it s a completely different technique 
Client:,Ingrates, it took you hours to make this bee  this is gonna take forever  you need to work in my studio since you needed so much guidance 
Me:,Ingrates, you hired me because you loved my art  i work much faster with clay that needs to go into a kiln  it s a totally different material  you ll need to trust me and let me work if you want me to do this 
Client:,Ingrates, i can t pay you what you quoted  you just took so long  what if we just did a few bugs in clay and photoshopped the rest of the drawing  how much would you charge for one bug 
Me:,Ingrates,      
Client:,Ingrates, that s way too much  
Me:,Ingrates, if i made this just to sell as an ornament  i d charge     because of how big you wanted it with all the details 
Client:,Ingrates,    well  we re gonna have to discuss this  come in tomorrow from   am  pm 
Me:,Ingrates, yeah cool  
Client:,Ingrates, hey  real quick   
Me:,Ingrates,  delete 
Client:,Ingrates, we ve just secured the artist we re using for the poster art  they ll send you a copy of the artwork as soon as it s finished 
Artist:,Ingrates, i ve finished the artwork  when would you like to come to pick it up 
Me:,Ingrates, could you scan it instead 
Artist:,Ingrates, i don t know how to scan images  is a photograph okay 
Client:,Ingrates, great  now can you set up the ticketing  also  can you send these to a printer and have them printed onto a  gloss paper  also  we ve made you an administrator on the play s facebook event page  can you update it and post photographs bios of the actors 
Me:,Ingrates, i didn t agree to do any of that  i don t even have enough information to set up the ticketing  only you can do that  i m not organizing the printing either but i can recommend a reputable printer 
Client:,Ingrates, the posters have arrived  they look great  please come down later today and post them around town  the production is soon 
Client: ,Ingrates,   where s the rest of it 
Me:,Ingrates, the rest of it 
Client: ,Ingrates, i could have got some guy in india to build this for       it s taken you   days  that s cost me       
Me:,Ingrates,  ignoring the brazen insult     not really  it s cost you a week of my wage  as this was built internally for our product line and not for a client in particular  that money can be made back in   order at your rates  by the way  and besides i could have turned it around quicker if i wasn t covering other projects during that time  
Director:,Ingrates, i don t think you re that busy 
Me:,Ingrates,    
Me:,Ingrates, this deadline is really tight  i might have to ask my developer to work on a weekend just to meet it  i don t really like asking my guys to do that  are you sure it s necessary  
Client:,Ingrates, good  i m your paying client  i expect you to work round the clock until the website is done 
Client: ,Ingrates, we re in a huge bind  we have an event two days from now and their photographer isn t getting back to us  we think they re flaking out on us and we need someone to cover it    
Client: ,Ingrates,our other photographer was charging us        
Client: ,Ingrates,do you accept credit cards as payment  
Client: ,Ingrates,you didn t confirm  i need you to confirm  
Client: ,Ingrates,can i pay you after i receive the photos  
Me: ,Ingrates,no  
Me:,Ingrates, i can get to fixing it  but i m out on a shoot today  i ll get to it when i m home

Me:,Ingrates, alright can we get some samples to start developing the software and design the inspection strategy 
Client:,Ingrates, sure  i ll just note that down and we will write the scope on the contract 
Client:,Ingrates, what change of scope are you talking about 
Me:,Ingrates, you stated there would be only four references to inspect  we got a box with     different references   
Client:,Ingrates, oh no no  each reference has   different stylings  the scope is still the same 
Me:,Ingrates, alright  i ve got a b c and d ready  i will send you the finished files in a second  and later that day  i m going to finish e f g and h 
Client:,Ingrates, yeah  if you could send me e f g and h right now  that would be great

Me:,Ingrates, i m sorry but you ve missed your appointment  i called to confirm and you didn t answer or return my messages to say you would be running late 
Client: ,Ingrates,we were waiting for family who had to fly in  they are on their way now  this is very unprofessional of you  
Client:,Ingrates, i ve got a  pm conference with pat from  big corporation   
Me:,Ingrates, what kind of bonus are we talking about  you know i have to stay up all night to finish them and i have no direction for the second video so it will be my writing

Client:,Ingrates, oh no  remember i am financing this out of my pocket   
Me:,Ingrates, you will have your videos in two days like we had planned 
Client:,Ingrates, so i want highest resolution retina canvas with clean line art  realistic  full colour and shading  a detailed background  and ten characters 
Me: ,Ingrates, adding up the numbers  well  i guess i can do that if you give me a couple months  that ll be somewhere around

Client:,Ingrates, here are our november and holiday specials  please post these asap 
Client: ,Ingrates,those aren t our deals  those were only preliminary  here are our actual sales  we ve had these for two weeks  you should have asked before you did all of that work

Client:,Ingrates, i actually need you to send it to me now

Me:,Ingrates,  
Me:,Ingrates, sorry  i can t accept this booking  i could never meet the deadline 
Client:,Ingrates, why 
Me:,Ingrates, well  because it s at least    hours of work 
Client:,Ingrates, so  the deadline is    hours away 
Client:,Ingrates, can you call me  i have a checklist of things i need to go over and i need them for a presentation with one of my clients by tomorrow 
Me: ,Ingrates,today is my surgery  i m not going to be available until next week  as i stated in my email  i also won t be able to make any more edits until you ve paid up for the design work and site edits from two weeks ago 
Client: ,Ingrates,are they putting you under general anesthesia 
Me:,Ingrates, yes  why 
Client: ,Ingrates,oh  i guess that is a good excuse then  can you at least call me tomorrow to go over everything  i think i can only push this off for a day 
Me: ,Ingrates,no  i m going to be taking percocet for the next week and i will not be doing any business while taking any pain killers  you were told about this three times  i can give you the email to another designer i work with if this is urgent 
Client: ,Ingrates,sure  can you get them my logo and files 
Me: ,Ingrates,i sent you copies of all of these files last week  they re in your email 
Client: ,Ingrates,i know  but i don t want to dig through them 
Me: ,Ingrates,fine  i ve got to go 
Client: ,Ingrates,okay  remember  
Client:,Ingrates, i need a flyer done as soon as possible  if you can  here s all the information
Me:,Ingrates, okay  sounds good  i ll get it done as soon as i can 
Client:,Ingrates, actually  i need it done by tomorrow afternoon 
Me:,Ingrates, okay 
Client:,Ingrates, looks great  but i sent you all the wrong information  here is the new information for a completely different event with a totally different theme  
Client: ,Ingrates,are you still doing that graphics stuff 
Client:,Ingrates, you cannot charge us that  that is not a reasonable rate  i want a fixed price of     and 
Client:,Ingrates, ok so we would need you    hours a week and you would be getting unemployment benefits plus about     a week extra   this would be     a week total 
Me:,Ingrates, i m sorry  i was contacted about this as a designer and was told it was a temporary freelance contract  
Client:,Ingrates, it was  but we realised that with your age  you can work as part of a 
Client: ,Ingrates,major changes for the website  i need all done by     am  tomorrow  
Me: ,Ingrates, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post            we need to incorporate my pet ferrets into the  what s with the wedding  a 
Client:,Ingrates, i ll give you the price we agreed to and i signed a contract for  besides  you said you were unprepared   a real pro would be ready for anything 
Client:,Ingrates, i just received the layouts  i d prefer if you put the logo on the front too  right now  it looks sort of empty and you couldn t tell it was my truck unless you see it from the side  
Me:,Ingrates, where on the front would you like me to put the logo then  
Client:,Ingrates, in the middle of the upper front  there s a great big space there 
Me:,Ingrates, you mean like i did in option      and   
Client:,Ingrates, oh  well  i haven t looked at all of them yet   but i ll need some more options from you within the hour 
Client:,Ingrates, can you 
Me:,Ingrates, sure  do you want to use this photo for the album cover instead of the one we already have 
Client:,Ingrates, no  i just want to see 
Client:,Ingrates, cool  now can you do it in this photo  where i have a mohawk 
Me:,Ingrates, uh  i could   but am i getting paid for this 
Client:,Ingrates, i d rather not pay you for this  it s not for the album 
Me:,Ingrates, in that case  i d rather not do it 
Me: ,Ingrates,little typos or missing accents can occur during the transfer from text to image  if you need me to review the translation once the final layout has been completed  i will be happy to do it free of charge 
Me:,Ingrates, i would be happy to  it will cost  this much   please let me know if this works and i can get right on it 
Client:,Ingrates, what  
Me:,Ingrates, i do   for my work  that s not my work  and taking a glance at it  it seems like an automatic machine translation  there are a lot of changes to be made 
Client:,Ingrates,   so 
Client:,Ingrates, hi there  i haven t heard from you in a while  how is my order coming along  
Client:,Ingrates, hi  how s everything going over there     are you keeping well  have you finished my order yet 
Client:,Ingrates, look  you re taking your time here  i m not going to be played for a fool  get to work or give me my money back 
Client:,Ingrates, ideally  we d have you come in every day of the work week  from  am to  pm 
Me:,Ingrates, i m sorry  i thought this was a contract position 
Client:,Ingrates, it is  but we d like you around in case anything comes up 
Me:,Ingrates, sorry  i m a bit confused  this contract only allots    hours of my time  we d burn through that within three days 
Client:,Ingrates, oh  
Me:,Ingrates, i m sorry  but i don t work weekends  i can have it by wednesday 
Client:,Ingrates, but i thought you work from home 
Me:,Ingrates,   yes 
Client:,Ingrates, so if you re at home  
Client:,Ingrates, why aren t you answering my emails  i haven t heard from you since friday evening 
Me:,Ingrates, it s the weekend  
Client:,Ingrates, i think 
Me:,Ingrates, no 
Client:,Ingrates, fine  but you should know that i think you are making a very big mistake by not working weekends  regardless  i expect to see designs complete by monday morning 
Me:,Ingrates, i can t see how that would be possible  also  monday is a holiday  i will start working on tuesday and you can expect to see designs later that day 
Client:,Ingrates, in this current economic climate  you should work on bank holidays as well 
Me:,Ingrates, thanks for the advice  we can talk about it more on tuesday 
Client:,Ingrates, i emailed you all the stuff i needed done yesterday  is it done 
Me:,Ingrates, hm  i didn t see any emails before i went to bed  what time did you send the email 
Client:,Ingrates, 
Me:,Ingrates, sir  you sent this at midnight 
Client:,Ingrates, so is it done 
Client: ,Ingrates,just wondering how the newsletter is coming along  let me know if you have any questions  we d like to send something out by tomorrow afternoon  
Client:,Ingrates, i need a custom design for the brochure 
Me:,Ingrates, sure  can you let me know how you d like it to look  even a few bullet points would help 
Client:,Ingrates, i m 
Me:,Ingrates, we sent you the campaign proposal a few weeks ago and haven t received a response  have you guys seen it  remember that if you didn t like it  we can do an alternative 
Client:,Ingrates, we haven t seen it  do an alternative
Me: ,Ingrates,refresh your browser 
Me:,Ingrates, how did the banner work out 
Client:,Ingrates, what banner 
Me:,Ingrates, the banner i designed for you to display at  store  
Client:,Ingrates, oh  that  okay  i guess 
Me:,Ingrates, what do you mean  was something wrong 
Client:,Ingrates, i don t think so 
Me:,Ingrates, uh so it looked okay 
Client:,Ingrates, i don t know  i got busy and never made it to  store  to see it 
Me:,Ingrates, i thought you shopped there all the time 
Client:,Ingrates, normally  but 
Client:,Ingrates, but for that much  i can 
Me:,Ingrates, if you think you would like to have me on retainer to do site work or support  you can purchase a maintenance package and i can take care of requests with priority  i have a lot of clients on the go that i have to respond to first
Client:,Ingrates, no  just that link thing  i understand other clients have priority  if your tied up  you can just give me a time when we can revisit this 
Client:,Ingrates, all i would like is that link 
Client:,Ingrates, and the ability to do a gallery without the pictures looking wonky when i upload 
Client:,Ingrates, and those spreadsheets i sent you inserted into the pages 
Client:,Ingrates, thanks  see the attached for the rest  
Me:,Ingrates, what we do here takes a lot of effort  you can t just ask for something and not provide any details 
Client:,Ingrates, ha  effort  you re funny 
Me:,Ingrates, well  if it didn t take effort  why couldn t you 
Client:,Ingrates, i have a life and a job  i ll go find someone that will do whatever i tell him 
Client:,Ingrates, we d like you to work overtime on this project   right now you re only here    hours a week  we d like you to work       on it 
Me:,Ingrates, well  the current contract you set up specifies budget for only    hours weekly  but i m sure we can make some arrangements  i ll have to talk to my agency about the bill rate for the overtime  though 
Client:,Ingrates, oh   don t worry  that won t be necessary  we don t want you to actually 
Me:,Ingrates, it s probably quickest if you ask the printer to change the file on press 
Client:,Ingrates, no  i want you to make the change at the agency and send it to the printer again 
Me:,Ingrates, it s father s day  and it s not like i have to call in one or two people   i d have to call in a whole team   we re not working today  and it s not like it would be cost efficient for you to do it that way 
Client:,Ingrates, i don t care  i want you to do it 
Me:,Ingrates, i m sorry  it s the middle of the day on a sunday  it s father s day  and it s unlikely that i ll even be able to get in touch with everyone   i don t understand why you can t just have the printer make the change to the file on press 
Client:,Ingrates, 
Me:,Ingrates, neither are we 
Me:,Ingrates, 
Client:,Ingrates, we think this will work best if you just dive in  focus  and make it your own  just produce us a win  can you have it ready by  pm 
Editor’s Note:,Ingrates, em  this story was submitted with the client comments in green comic sans  which was impressive to include  but something i don t want to subject our readers to    em

Client:,Ingrates, i was thinking  could we get gold staples for the program 
Me: ,Ingrates,no  sorry  it s not going to be possible  they can only do silver staples 
Client:,Ingrates, oh  that s alright  what do you think about slipping some wax paper under each staple and coloring them gold 
Me: ,Ingrates,for     programs 
Client: ,Ingrates,yeah 
Me: ,Ingrates,for tomorrow 
Client: ,Ingrates,yeah 
Me: ,Ingrates, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post            its not that we dont want to pay you its just  will i be getting paid  a 
Client: ,Ingrates,no  of course not   that s only  like  a hundred staples  
Me:,Ingrates, dear client  please fill out our online form to setup your project  no matter what  please
 DO NOT attach anything to the form,Ingrates,  our server is acting up right now and attachments are causing issues  we are working to fix this  but can t be certain it will be fixed by day s end 
Client:,Ingrates, hi  i submitted the form yesterday but didn t receive confirmation  did you get it 
Me:,Ingrates, no  did you attach something to the form  that might be the issue 
Client:,Ingrates, yes  i attached our logo  i wish you would have warned me that there was an issue with attachments because now i ve wasted my time and have to do this all over again  and as i stated earlier  and i expect you to actually read my emails   
Client:,Ingrates, 
Me:,Ingrates, unfortunately  as i mentioned  i m unavailable at that time tomorrow   how about  pm   or i ll be available all day thursday 
Client:,Ingrates, no  none of that will do  tomorrow at noon 
Me:,Ingrates, unfortunately  that is outside of my posted office hours  which i sent to you on monday  you could always email me your requests  and i can contact you about them on thursday 
Client:,Ingrates, i don t want to contact you on thursday 
Me:,Ingrates, can i ask why thursday won t work for you 
Client:,Ingrates, because i don t want to have to call you outside of my normal office hours 
Client:,Ingrates, are you there  my contact s really anxious to get their site moving  can you get started on provisioning the server 
Me: ,Ingrates,no  i m not available for at least five more days 
Client:,Ingrates, what  
Me: ,Ingrates,my wife s on vicodin and the baby s teething 
Client:,Ingrates, so by tonight at least 
Client:,Ingrates, hello 
Client:,Ingrates, we re thinking of getting new business cards made up  you can do that kind of thing can t you 
Me: ,Ingrates,yeah sure  i charge for it though 
Client:,Ingrates, ha  nice one 
Me: ,Ingrates,no  seriously  i charge for it  even my friends have to pay 
Client:,Ingrates, why 
Me: ,Ingrates,because it s time consuming  i don t have much free time  so i charge people for eating in to it 
Client:,Ingrates, well  you can do it here while you re at work 
Me: ,Ingrates,i normally charge around      for design work  i get paid a little over    an hour here  
Client:,Ingrates, that s a ridiculous amount of money 
Me: ,Ingrates,i think you ll find it s about half the price of what professionals will charge 
Client:,Ingrates,      for an hours  work  that s insane 
Me: ,Ingrates,i can t design anything in an hour  i can maybe doodle something for you  but i can t design it properly in an hour 
Client:,Ingrates, i was hoping 
Me: ,Ingrates,i ll be having lunch in my lunch break 
Client:,Ingrates, what s so difficult  it s only messing around with paint 
Me: ,Ingrates,do you mean 
Client:,Ingrates, either or 
Client:  ,Ingrates,hey  how are you doing  you know  i seem to have a problem with my pc  i ve tried everything  but it just isn t working  no need for you to come here  i can bring it to you 
Me: ,Ingrates,you know  i m busy at work  and i can t really take a break 
Client:  ,Ingrates,yes  but it won t start  what am i supposed to do 
Me: ,Ingrates,take it to a service 
Client:  ,Ingrates,no way  
Me:,Ingrates, i received your request  unfortunately  the whole team is busy today  we ll respond to your request by  pm  
Client:,Ingrates, no  just make your team work faster  thanks 
Client:,Ingrates, i need to send my logo to a printers  but i don t know what one to send  i m just sending you all my files can you tell me what one to send 
Me: ,Ingrates,you ll want to use a vectorized one  preferably a file format like   
Client:,Ingrates, 
Me: ,Ingrates,you already sent them on skype   
Client: ,Ingrates,let s make time to make sure you get all the files  
Client:,Ingrates, we want you to change the shape of the character s head again 
Me:,Ingrates, i ve already explained to you that additional changes will cost extra  i ve already changed his hair  his clothes  and the facial features on about    characters  if you want me to do any more changes  i ll have to charge 
Client:,Ingrates, well  that isn t really in our budget right now  how about you do it for free  so we can stay under budget 
Me:,Ingrates, i m sorry  but you either need to reel back the changes you want or find more money  
Client:,Ingrates, 
Client:,Ingrates, 
Me:,Ingrates, absolutely could you email me a copy of their logo  and i ll do that in thirty minutes  when i get to my computer 
Client:,Ingrates, when are you planning on getting to your computer 
Me:,Ingrates, it s snowing  and i m about    miles out in rush hour traffic  so it should take me about thirty minutes 
Client:,Ingrates, you can do this on your iphone  
Me:,Ingrates, i m in traffic  and it is snowing 
Client:,Ingrates, don t worry  you can look on their website for more logos 
Client:,Ingrates, i need you to send the ad we re working on to the newspaper right now so they can run it tuesday 
Me:,Ingrates, i didn t think we were finished with the ad  besides  it s a holiday and i m not at the office 
Client:,Ingrates, what s wrong with you  you should take your work home in case i need something 
Me:,Ingrates, i emailed you the latest draft before i left the office last  
Client:,Ingrates, i don t have access to my email right now  
Client:,Ingrates, i need you to be here to start the sale  monitor it  and then close it when it s done 
Me: ,Ingrates,i notified you over a month ago that we would not be available  we re moving  you acknowledged that and agreed to hold off on the sale until our move was complete 
Client: ,Ingrates,i know  but i ve changed my mind  this is the better time for the sale and really  it s completely unprofessional of you to move in the middle of my busy season 
Me: ,Ingrates,i m not sure what to say   it s not like i can change our move date  our house has been sold  the truck has departed  and we have to be at the new house in just a few days 
Client: ,Ingrates,well  
Client:,Frenemies, i am not paying you this much 
Me:,Frenemies, well  for the amount of work involved this is best i can do  you want 
Client: ,Frenemies,toy story themed   paste his face on woody s head  maybe buzz light year to the side  i dunno you can design however you want  toy story fonts  toy story backgrounds  etc 
Me: ,Frenemies, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post             i usually dont do work related favors for family  we need to talk   a 
Client:  ,Frenemies, but i don t want it super themey 
Client:,Frenemies, i am not paying you this much 
Me:,Frenemies, well  for the amount of work involved this is best i can do  you want 
Client: ,Frenemies,toy story themed   paste his face on woody s head  maybe buzz light year to the side  i dunno you can design however you want  toy story fonts  toy story backgrounds  etc 
Me: ,Frenemies, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post             i usually dont do work related favors for family  we need to talk   a 
Client:  ,Frenemies, but i don t want it super themey 
Client:,Frenemies, i want to make a 
Me:,Frenemies, ok  great  what did you have in mind 
Me:,Frenemies, ok  um  yeah  we could do that  i could write a script for  low price because he s a friend  and then i know a few people who could work on the commercial at a discount  we d just need to get a good location and 
Client:,Frenemies, oh  i ve got the location  we can shoot in my backyard 
Me:,Frenemies, oh 
Client:,Frenemies, and i wouldn t be paying anybody   especially at those prices  but i m sure when they hear the project  they d love to jump on board 
Me:,Frenemies, well  all the people i mentioned are professionals and  
Client:,Frenemies, do you know how many people would kill for an opportunity like this  this could make us all a lot of money 
Me:,Frenemies, well  again  they re all professionals and would need to get paid up front for their time on set 
Client:,Frenemies, but they re just friends of yours  and we ll be shooting in my backyard 
Me:,Frenemies, yeah  but these friends of mine are working professionals who make way more than the prices i mentioned  i might be able to convince them to work at that rate since it s my script we d be producing  but i won t be able to push any further than that 
Client:,Frenemies, but i m sure they d love this project and want to jump on board 
Me:,Frenemies, for free 
Client:,Frenemies, exactly 
Me:,Frenemies, you know what  i actually don t think i ll have time 
Client:,Frenemies, oh  that sucks  well  give me your friends  contact info so i can still get them 
Client:,Frenemies, why did you remove my site 
Me:,Frenemies, because you have ignored my past attempts of contacting you for payment for my work 
Client:,Frenemies, oh  well   about that  i didn t think i should pay you for this site 
Me:,Frenemies, why 
Client:,Frenemies, well after about a week  i didn t receive any customers or traffic to the site  i don t think you did your job very well if it can t instantly grab attention of the public and bring them to my site 
Me:,Frenemies, then why do you still want the site 
Client (10:11PM):,Frenemies, i want to talk sometime before      pm tonight  i m really ready for this to get off the ground 
Client (10:44PM): ,Frenemies,i guess we re not talking tonight  i m getting very tired of waiting on this  email me back asap 
Client (11:07PM): ,Frenemies,i m going to find someone else to do this  it s clear that you just can t reply in a timely manner 
Client:,Frenemies,your grandfather s yahoo is broken 
Me:,Frenemies, his yahoo  what  do you mean the email account has a problem  or is the website down 
Client:,Frenemies, yes  his email  you have to fix it  do you have a few minutes 
Me:,Frenemies, i live in toronto  remember  he lives over two hours from here 
Client:,Frenemies, no  i mean over the phone  you tell me  i ll call him and tell him what to do  i think yahoo has a virus 
Me:,Frenemies, you mean you think his email was hacked 
Client:,Frenemies, no  a 
Me:,Frenemies, are you sure he isn t typing his new password in wrong  
Client:,Frenemies, no  that s ridiculous  it must be a virus  can you  like  google a virus 
Me:,Frenemies, uh  yeah  i ll call you back 
Client:,Frenemies, it works  everything is fine  problem solved and your grandfather is relieved 
Me:,Frenemies, good  i m glad the virus is gone 
Client:,Frenemies, don t be silly  it was the password  he wasn t typing it in right  your grandfather s very old  you know 
Client: ,Frenemies,what are these 
Me:,Frenemies, illustrations  like you asked me to do 
Client: ,Frenemies,actually  we were hoping for you to redesign the website  these are nice though 
Me: ,Frenemies,well  i can redesign the website too  but i ll have to charge a separate fee for that 
Client: ,Frenemies, i spoke to some of the other guys in the company  we were hoping that 
Me:,Frenemies, but you said this was paid work 
Client: ,Frenemies,only to get you interested 
Client:,Frenemies, hey  i just downloaded photoshop  how do i save jpegs as  eps in good quality  we need to get our company clothes printed asap and the printer doesn t accept jpeg 
Me:,Frenemies, don t you have your logo in vector format 
Client:,Frenemies, the old one s vectorized  but we only have small jpegs of the new one  also  i made some adjustments  photoshop lets me save as  eps  but it looks kind of bad 
Me:,Frenemies, you can t do that  why not contact the agency that made the logo 
Client:,Frenemies, that was a few months ago  and we 
Me:,Frenemies, hey  did you take me 
Client:,Frenemies, yes 
Me:,Frenemies, why is that 
Me: ,Frenemies,what s going on 
Client:,Frenemies, we hired someone else       not willing to pay what you want 
Me:,Frenemies, well  thanks for the opportunity and i m sorry it didn t work out  i would have preferred you talked to me instead of changing the passwords on work as i complete it  regardless  good luck 
Client:,Frenemies,  drunk via text  i tired to talk to you about it when u were here and said he had talked with you we had a lady already doing it he was shocked on what you wanted to charge thanks 
Client: ,Frenemies,good job  but who told you to do this  
Client:,Frenemies, i appreciate this  i can t do what you do  
Me: ,Frenemies,thanks man  that   
Client:,Frenemies, because 
Client:,Frenemies, i m looking for an online editor that can do a short video in a couple of days  all the offline editing will be done by the director and you ll just do the effects and clean ups  
Me:,Frenemies, do you have exactly what needs to be done  and how many days  exactly  i can give you my answer if i know more of the details 
Client:,Frenemies, it s just basic effects and clean ups  probably five or so days  the payment will be x since we re already almost over budget  i hope that s okay with you 
Me:,Frenemies, can we meet up and discuss the project  
Client:,Frenemies, i ll text you 
Client:,Frenemies, turns out you ll be doing both the offline and online editing  you ll get the footage on saturday  the video was due sunday   pay is still the same  
Me: ,Frenemies,i m sorry  i m not available to do all that work in that amount of time 
Client:,Frenemies, how about you find someone to help you and you split the work and the money 
Me: ,Frenemies,honestly  this won t be 
Client:,Frenemies, don t use a real professional then  use a friend  that s what i would do  
Me: ,Frenemies,yes  i know  
Me: ,Frenemies,hey  what s this for 
Client:  ,Frenemies,a tip for that card  
Client:,Frenemies, 
Me:,Frenemies, o okay  do you have something in mind 
Client:,Frenemies, yes  we want our website just like this  example site   
Me:,Frenemies, it s a relief you have a good idea of what you want if there s a rush to get this made  do you have a rough estimate of how much you want to spend 
Client:,Frenemies, we like to work like a family here 
Me:,Frenemies, that s a great way to work 
Client:,Frenemies, so we don t pay out money as wages are so low  
Me:,Frenemies, how does that work  
Client:,Frenemies, if you are as good as you say you are  you ll be willing to work on a commission basis  if we feel our website s getting enough sales  we are willing to pay you your commission  
Me:,Frenemies, that won t be possible for me  i need money to live 
Client:,Frenemies, this is how we work  take it or leave it  
Me:,Frenemies, since there is nothing to leave  i m going to have to say no 
Client:,Frenemies, it takes a real  professional to work with us  i suspected you wouldn t be up to the task 
who is paid,Frenemies, to undertake a specialized set of tasks and to complete them for a fee 
Client: ,Frenemies,hey   client  tells me you could 
Me:,Frenemies, depends  what s the question 
Client: ,Frenemies,my computer stopped working the other day  the light comes on but nothing happens 
Me:,Frenemies, well  it s hard to say what might be the problem from just that  it could be something simple  it could be that something needs replacing  
Client: ,Frenemies, pfft  that s the best you can come up with  what a waste of my time  
Client:,Frenemies, my sister in law saw the visuals  and 
Me:,Frenemies, what didn t she like about them 
Client:,Frenemies, she said they were shit and not worth the money 
Me:,Frenemies, do you think that 
Client:,Frenemies, i haven t looked at any of them yet

Me:,Frenemies, you re charging me for providing you with a free shoot 
Client:,Frenemies, you claimed you could provide a service and we set our time scale to that promise  you ve failed to deliver and you re costing us money  therefore we ve sent you the invoice

Me: ,Racists,oh  i m sorry  i don t really see it but i can change them if you don t  like them  
Client: ,Racists,the best way to get along is if you treat this like   mile  i am eminem and you are all my n    rs 
Client: ,Racists,that s 
Me: ,Racists,i agree  let me see what else i can bring up  
Client: ,Racists,maybe diverse enough 
Client: ,Racists,that s more diverse 
Client: ,Racists,that s the most diverse 
Client: ,Racists,it looks racist to me  those ants are stereotypes of african americans

Client: ,Racists,perfect  use that  just make him black and older 
Client:,Racists, i want this bit of the copy in italian 
Me: ,Racists,i   okay  but can i ask why 
Client:,Racists, i like how it looks 
Me: ,Racists,okay  but this is intended for an english speaking audience  right  won t they  
Client:,Racists, listen  it s simple  just put these sections in italian and we re done 
Client:,Racists, what s this 
Me: ,Racists,it s   i put those parts in italian  like you asked

Client:,Racists, you know  
Me: ,Racists,you wanted it in italics 
Client:,Racists, i don t know what that is  but slant it up a notch or we ll have a problem  
Client:,Racists, the mix sounds good  but i m not sure about the vocals 
Me:,Racists, what s wrong with them 
Client:,Racists, they re just not black enough 
Client:,Racists, what s kwanza 
Me:,Racists, it s a celebration in december 
Client:,Racists, no  i m pretty sure 
Me:,Racists, what s the issue  have you changed the act 
Client:,Racists, no  we just don t think he looks right on the background 
Me:,Racists, do you have another image from his pr guys  
Client:,Racists, no  but it s a simple fix  we want you to make him less black  
Me:,Racists, er  i can t really do that  he s a world famous singer and i don t think he s going to appreciate us 
Client:,Racists, but our background is black  and he is black  you need to change his face

Me:,Racists, i m sorry  but this is how i work  
Client:,Racists,  this is how i work   the payment isn t guaranteed  but neither is the quality of work  there is a south african designer with the same rate as yours  who accepts work without any down payment  and his portfolio is bigger than yours  and i m also considering him a candidate  i put you on top of my list because you are french and because you are a woman  never mind  i ll let you work  this way  with others  i went out of my way to put you on top of my list and this is how you treat me  such a human misery 
Client:,Racists, can t we just get find cheap mexican to do it for  like     bucks

Client:,Criminals, i don t need changes now  i need to be able to change it in the future  and i need to be able to print it now  every other printer that has designed something for me has given me a printable file  i plan to bring you tons of business and you are hurting my business by not providing me with the password

Me:,Criminals, i did  this was the best i could find 
Client: ,Criminals,let me check 
Client: ,Criminals,oh  hey  see  this one s better

Client:,Criminals, so  we are going to do a great concert  at this amazing venue  there are all kinds of artist that are willing to work with us for free  but they are all c listers  we really want a list artists  we also want a full crew of volunteers to do everything from sounds and lighting to stagehands  greeters  bar staff  pa s to the artists  promotions  etc  besides that  we need full media coverage  and of course a great media campaign  we don t really have anything yet  everything needs to be organized and designed  we have about six months to pull this together  since we ve already put in a lot of time in the last event  we decided that you get to do this one 
Me: ,Criminals,you mean you want me to fully organize this massive event 
Me: ,Criminals,good  
Client: ,Criminals,we keep the last say in everything  you don t get to make the final decisions  but other than that  yes 
Me:,Criminals,    okay  that is a lot of work for one person  if i would basically carry the sole responsibility for this and have my name tied to it  i would like to get some insight into the finances of the foundation  i m sure you can understand that 
Me:,Criminals, okay  then at least what is your budget for this 
Me: ,Criminals,   
Client: ,Criminals,you re very serious  you shouldn t be so serious 
Client:,Criminals, i m not going to give you appropriate credits on my project 
Me:,Criminals, why  i literally did everything in it 
Client,Criminals,  if i credited every person for their work  i wouldn t look so cool 
Me:,Criminals, but crediting people means being honest 
Client:,Criminals, now i feel conflicted 
Me: ,Criminals,well that s a surprise  i ll have to think about it  
Client:,Criminals, well i can see if we have another project you can work on  but if not  i will have to terminate our contract 
Client:,Criminals, i m calling to ask if you can reconsider forwarding your services to our business partner  we have something special planned for you there   
Me: ,Criminals,well i m definitely not comfortable with that  
Client: ,Criminals,don t tell anyone  this call and everything said falls under our nda  think about it  ok 
Client:,Criminals, hi  do you 
Me:,Criminals, yes  i m proficient with photoshop  how can i help you  
Client,Criminals,  i wanted to know if you do logo editing  
Me:,Criminals, logo editing  
Client:,Criminals, yes  i have a professionally made logo  and i need it edited 
Me:,Criminals, i see    well  what changes are you looking for  
Client:,Criminals, i need the semi transparent thing over the main picture removed and the blurry edges made better 
Client:,Criminals, i want you to get increase our customer base and get our existing customer to register for charity competitions 
Me:,Criminals, we can construct a content marketing plan to build authority and engage the audience  driving them to your website  we can try marketing to your existing audience to encourage sign ups for your charity competitions and use the charity fundraiser story to tell the story of the brand 
Client: ,Criminals,sounds great 
Me: ,Criminals,oh  i ll need access to your website to redesign it so that there are clear calls to action  sign up forms with ecommerce and design landing pages for various campaigns 
Client:,Criminals, you can t have access to the site until the developer has finished with it  at the end of the month 
Me:,Criminals, ok  why not direct them to add these changes while they are still under contract to complete the site 
Client:,Criminals, will do 
Me:,Criminals, i haven t seen any updates on your site  can i at least have access to your 
Client:,Criminals, you will at the end of this month 
Me:,Criminals, fine  but your first charity competition is now only several weeks away  we don t have much time to generate registrations and the site still has no call to action or e commerce registration forms so we can t grow the database 
Client:,Criminals, the web company owns the website  we will never have access and we can t afford to ask them for updates  there is no client database  we need charity registrations now or the company won t survive 
Me:,Criminals, what  why are you only telling me this now  no database  what have you been doing for the past year  oh  and your third invoice payment is late again  will you be paying this now 
Client:,Criminals, we don t want to work with you anymore and won t be paying you  we expect results immediately 
Me:,Criminals, but you signed a contract stating you understood content marketing results would be at least six months  if you are canceling fine  but there is a    day notice period  i need this in writing 
Me: ,Criminals,i don t understand why you needed the charity event grossing       to keep the company afloat  are you not giving the money to the charity 
Client:,Criminals, we want to sue you for loss of earnings as the charity cost        to run and your content marketing isn t working fast enough 
Me:,Criminals, so you spent        with target earnings of       for yourself and passing it off as a charity event  you think something that will take six months to work should happen immediately and i m to blame 
Client:,Criminals, yes 
Me:,Criminals, i m just following up on the installation we made last week at your factory so we can tie things up before your final payment  
Client:,Criminals, we are still reading through the documentation and validating the installation  please call me later next week

Client:,Criminals, yes 
Client: ,Criminals,can you fix a piece of paper if i give you a copy 
Me:,Criminals, yeah  i can scan it in and photoshop it   is this for work 
Me:,Criminals, it depends   
Client:,Criminals, my wife asked me for a copy of the phone bill and i need a couple of numbers removed   sends file 
Client:,Criminals, i hear so many complaints from customers  i am immune to it by now  i feel like a surgeon  and after a while  it just feels like business as usual 
Me:,Criminals, i m sorry to hear that  it s important to get their complaints resolved as soon as possible these days  as customers provide feedback online 
Client:,Criminals, i don t have time to figure out their concerns  i am providing useful products and services  this is how i run my business 
Client:,Criminals, on the window it shows our food hygiene rating of   stars  that doesn t look good for the advert so can you photoshop   stars instead 
Me:,Criminals, that s not only dishonest  but illegal 
Client:,Criminals, so what  we deserve   stars 
Me:,Criminals, here is the mockup of the webpage you asked for  since no images or text or content was provided i have used place holder images and  lorem ipsum  text for the mock just for visual assessment  
Client:,Criminals, looks good but are we really going to use those pictures  also  i m not sure where you got that content but it s wrong  we ll be changing that  here s some photos for you to use 
Me: ,Criminals,no  like i said you never sent over any images assets or content so i ve used generic photos and text to mock up the content within the layout  i chose what i thought were images close to the message of the page but we can surely change them out once you ve approved the layout  is the layout what you ve imagined  also  we cannot use those images as they are watermarked and must be purchased before using them 
Client: ,Criminals, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post           can you please remove the istockphoto watermark on  can t you just photoshop the watermark out   a

Client:,Criminals, my boss was disappointed when you asked us for the copy for the site  he said he didn t pay you so that he would have to write the text himself 
Me: ,Criminals,how am i supposed to know what to write on your site  i don t know anything about your business and what you offer  not to mention that the contract explicitly states that the client must provide the copy  
Client: ,Criminals,my boss said he will be speaking with his lawyer about suing you 
Me: ,Criminals,okay  how do you want this to be edited 
Client: ,Criminals, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post             while discussing how to fit an entire production  i want you to make  em magic  em    a

Client: ,Criminals,of course i do  i talked to them 
Me:,Criminals,  after i received the cease and desist letter and turned over the files  i didn t see a need to continue working for your company for free  my last email stated i would be deleting the contents of my server after a month  the end of our original contract  in order to avoid any further legal trouble  didn t you copy or save any of the files that i sent you throughout the year 
Client:,Criminals, no  why would i  just send me the files that you compiled for my company over the last year 
Me: ,Criminals,i deleted them after i sent the last email 
Client: ,Criminals,what   why 
Me: ,Criminals,because i fulfilled my contractual obligations and the language of your letter implied i would be held accountable if i still had access to any work i did for you 
Client: ,Criminals,well that was stupid 
Me: ,Criminals,agreed 
Client:,Criminals, oh  this music i sent you to use for the animation is copyrighted  now i can t

Me:,Criminals, apologies for the delay on my response  i do not work over the weekend  we cannot give you a full refund as we ve already completed and installed your new design that you signed off on  you are currently using it 
Client:,Criminals, please stop harassing me with your emails  you ll be hearing from my attorney 
Client:,Criminals, i need you to use this image for the banner  
Me:,Criminals, this is a preview image  if we want to use it we ll need to buy the image to remove the watermark  
Client:,Criminals, we already have the image  can t you just edit it out  
Me:,Criminals, no  we would need to buy it  you can get the full version here  linked to stock image   
Client:,Criminals, okay  we bought it and 
Me:,Criminals, do you have permission of the photographer whose name and website are watermarked on this picture  if you just use 
Client:,Criminals, i don t know  i mean  is the photographer really going to find them  can t we just crop and resave them under a different name

Client: ,Criminals,fine  sexier  make her sexier 
Client:,Criminals, i have this stuff i got from work   spares and stuff   i need a website where i can put pictures of it up and sell it  possibly where people can bid  like an auction 
Me:,Criminals, you mean ebay 
Client:,Criminals, yes just like that 
Me:,Criminals, why not use ebay then 
Client:,Criminals, my boss might see the stuff i have 
Client:,Criminals, i love the album cover  but it s 
Me:,Criminals, what sort of effects did you have in mind 
Client:,Criminals, pot smoke 
Client:,Criminals, hi  we d like 
Me:,Criminals, i ve read over your request and i just want to give you a heads up now  a lot of what you re requesting goes against branding regulations and waivers that i wouldn t have the legal rights to  i d be happy to chat with you in person about what all of that entails 
Client:,Criminals, ugh  i ll have to talk it over with my boss  this is her idea and i just think it s too brilliant to be bothered by regulations and rules 
Client:,Criminals, use 
Me:,Criminals, but that s the university of michigan s logo  not michigan state s 
Client:,Criminals, i like this one better  and nobody outside of michigan will notice anyway 
Client:,Criminals, about a year ago  we had you make some edits to 
Me:,Criminals, alright  let me know how many of each you want and when you need them by  i ll get you prices after that 
Client:,Criminals, well  our compliance audit is next week  so we need about    copies of each by then so we can show that we are in compliance 
Client:,Criminals, i m sure  mutual friend  told you enough about me that you know better than to steal my idea anyways  
Me,Criminals,  haha  yeah  he mentioned you were a lawyer  
Client:,Criminals, oh  i meant how good i am with a crossbow  
Me:,Criminals, do you have a list of products and any images to accompany them 
Client:,Criminals, oh we re pretty much going to be selling everything on           com s site 
Me:,Criminals, there are several thousand products   all of them 
Client:,Criminals, yep  just take the photos and descriptions from them and put them on our site 
Me:,Criminals, i 
Client:,Criminals, oh  i know  when you copy their verbiage  just replace their name with ours 
Me:,Criminals, why did last year s financials change all of a sudden 
Client:,Criminals, they look 
Client:,Criminals, can you 
Me:,Criminals, it s a passport photo  that would be illegal 
Client:,Criminals, can you do it anyway 
Me:,Criminals, even if i did  it would be rejected 
Client:,Criminals, won t your guarantee cover that 
Client:,Criminals, what do you think of my website 
Me:,Criminals, having a bunch of 
Client:,Criminals, we don t have any photos 
Me:,Criminals, ok  but the stock photos you use still have the copyright watermarks  you need to purchase those images to get high res photos that are free of watermarks
Client:,Criminals, really   how much would you charge to remove those 
Me:,Criminals, remove what  the stock photos 
Client:,Criminals, the watermarks 
Me:,Criminals, 
Client:,Criminals, that s not my problem  figure it out 
Client:,Criminals, i m not going to pay for photos  just grab something generic off the internet that someone can t claim is theirs 
Client:,Criminals, can you make a copy of this picture 
Me:,Criminals, unfortunately no  i am not allowed 
Client:,Criminals, what do you mean 
Me:,Criminals, this image is 
Client:,Criminals, so you don t have the equipment  you can t do it  you have all these big machines  surely you can do it 
Me:,Criminals, i can do it  i m just not allowed to  in theory  i can make a copy  in practice  it is illegal to copy a photographer s work 
Client:,Criminals, but i ve had this done somewhere else before 
Me:,Criminals, then they were breaking the law  i m sorry  i just can t help you  i can lose my job  get fined  or go to jail  it s the law 
Client:,Criminals, i don t understand  if we close the door  and i promise not to tell anybody  then it s okay 
Me:,Criminals, so if we close the door  and i murder my colleague  but you don t tell anybody  is that okay 
Me:,Criminals, in accordance with the contract  you owe me x 
Client: ,Criminals,that s quite a lot of money  how about i don t tell anyone 
Me:,Criminals, i didn t sleep with any of your models 
Client:,Criminals, how about instead of payment  i organize that 
Client: ,Criminals,find attached the text for our terms and conditions  remember to include this  as it s only protection against theft  simply copy and paste the text 
Client: ,Criminals,could you just like photoshop my face at the bottom of the pot or something 
Client: ,Criminals,thanks  but it s not quite right  can you try it with one of these instead 
Me:,Criminals, sure  where are you getting these pictures anyways 
Client: ,Criminals,i d rather not say 
Me:,Criminals, do you have a logo 
Client:,Criminals, yes  
Me:,Criminals, cool  i ll take a look at it and add it to the header  can you send it to me 
Client:,Criminals, you can find it on google images  search for  globe  and check page    there s a nice blue one i like 
Me:,Criminals, is this content really the final version  it seems like it was a 
Client:,Criminals, good eye  it actually is copied from our competitor  just change the e mails to ours 
Client:,Criminals, can t believe i m paying you when i have to solve these problems  
Client:  ,Criminals,here s a youtube link to the song we want   what format do you need the audio in 
Me: ,Criminals,i can handle any audio format you provide me as long as you can handle the legal implications of publicly unlicensed copyrighted material 
Client: ,Criminals,but it s not rem 
Me:,Criminals, you ll face the same issues with madonna 
Me:,Criminals, i did everything you asked me to  what is the problem 
Client:,Criminals, our competitor has a slide show of all their products  i want that 
Me:,Criminals, i can put in a slideshow for you  just supply me with the  
Client:,Criminals, no  i want that slideshow 
Me:,Criminals, you want me to take the photos off of 
Client:,Criminals, yes 
Client: ,Criminals,here is the final version of the logo  can you please add this to the site and then push it live 
Me:,Criminals, i ll add the logo to the site  but don t you think that it looks very similar to 
Client: ,Criminals,what  it looks nothing like 
Client: ,Criminals,you need to 
Me:,Criminals, i m on it  did you want your cousin to design a new one  or should i   
Client:,Criminals, that stupid bastard is dead to me  and you will be too if you don t catch the mistake next time

Client: ,Chaotic Good,i don t think we should be working with you because you proposed technologies before we decided on functionalities  
Me: ,Chaotic Good, flipping table in rage 
Me:,Chaotic Good, good morning  client  how are you 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,confused  i have    mirrors of type      of type    too many of type    but none of type   when i should have    and i should have

Me:,Chaotic Good, uh  for me to do this i will need to have full control of the pc  without your input  we cannot both use the pc at the same time  would you like me to connect again later  
Client:,Chaotic Good, no  it s ok 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,it s a quick job   i just need you to stop typing and using the mouse so i can get it done

Client:,Chaotic Good, so you do a lot of freelance work  are you like a starving artist or something 
Me:,Chaotic Good, well  freelancing has allowed me to learn a lot of my skills  and work on a variety of projects  it s going pretty well  
Client:,Chaotic Good, i mean   why don t you get a career planner   
Me:,Chaotic Good, have you followed up on this customer concern that i sent you an e mail about a few days ago  the customer called again to follow up and said she hadn t heard from anyone 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,the customer should know better than to ask about that  i mean  it s complicated  
Me: ,Chaotic Good,okay

Me: ,Chaotic Good,okay   
Me:,Chaotic Good, are you going to call the customer  then 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i know how to do my job 
Me:,Chaotic Good, how was your vacation 
Client:,Chaotic Good, good   how was yours 
Me:,Chaotic Good,    um  i wasn t on vacation   i was here working on projects 
Client:,Chaotic Good, well    let s face it   when i m not here  nothing gets done   unless you got everything i left you with finished  then you were pretty much on vacation 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,you wasted my time  and you ruined christmas  
Client,Chaotic Good,  cool  these are the best proposal ever  let s start with strategy    can you put in action in a week 
Client,Chaotic Good,  well  seems like you re not doing the job  we ve been waiting a week 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i ve sent you emails here and here to have your input 
Client:,Chaotic Good,  angry  no way  we never got your emails 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i can prove emails were sent  received and read as i have the receipt 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,who the hell did you send them to  we didn t get those emails  and we don t use that email address  so either you re lying and didn t do the job or you just sent our campaign to a stranger  either way  you re incompetent  
Client,Chaotic Good,  uh well  we think we ll go for strategy a  good job on these 
Me:,Chaotic Good, so  what s led you to hire someone now for this freelance role 
Client:,Chaotic Good, well  my business created a large amount of jewelry and clothing items for media and trade show events  but it didn t pan out the way i wanted it to  so now  i have tons of merchandise in warehouses  i m looking for someone to help me sell the items pretty quickly online 
Me:,Chaotic Good, how are your sales doing on your website 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i m only selling a couple hundred dollars or so of items a month on my website  most of my partnerships and pr efforts didn t create the long lasting results the way i had hoped 
Me:,Chaotic Good, hm  well  how many more items are you looking to sell quickly 
Client:,Chaotic Good, many many thousands of dollars worth  my business produced mass quantities  the large warehouse bills are adding up quickly and i don t want to hold on to the items much longer 
Hiring Manager:,Chaotic Good, the client is often argumentative  angry and accusatory in meetings  you will have to bear the brunt of a lot of it  but  it s a great chance to work on exciting things 
Me:,Chaotic Good, hm  well  i ve seen a lot  i think i could handle it 
Hiring Manager:,Chaotic Good, it s important that we just do as he says and try to keep him happy 
Me:,Chaotic Good, okay 
Hiring Manager: ,Chaotic Good,i m not kidding  everything he says  down to the letter  this is important 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,   i ll think about it 
Client:,Chaotic Good, in your opinion  describe some important aspects of managing a design project 
Me:,Chaotic Good, well  it s useful to discuss the overall objective and any details of the project that have been determined  such as the font 
Client:,Chaotic Good, you mean i need a font 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i wouldn t be surprised if fights break out at the event between salespeople or among customers  we should probably have security 
Me:,Chaotic Good, that doesn t sound good 
Boss: ,Chaotic Good,that s great but 
Me:,Chaotic Good, here are the final final logo designs as discussed  
Client:,Chaotic Good, great  by the way  i want them to be editable so i can make changes in future  
Me:,Chaotic Good, that s     not very usual  the logo should be consistent so that we build up recognition and people value it and the program  
Client:,Chaotic Good, but it may not work in all contexts  
Me:,Chaotic Good, well if it needs updating later  we can ask the agency to do a refresh  
Client:,Chaotic Good, they charge too much  i just want to be able to do it myself  
Me:,Chaotic Good, they re the specialists  design work should be handled properly so the results are fully realized and high quality   and they have the specialist software to edit the files  
Client:,Chaotic Good, don t worry    i m getting photoshop installed on my laptop   just be sure to get the original files from the designers   
Client: ,Chaotic Good,my friends at the nsa told me that all my emails were being read by american and delta 
Client:,Chaotic Good, what s going on the website  what influencer platform will you use  who do i hire to create an in house agency  
Me: ,Chaotic Good,great questions  but everything you re asking is exactly what you d pay me to deliver  i don t have answers yet because that will take a bit of research  and even if i did have them i would need a contract before i give you those answers 
Me:,Chaotic Good, it looks like this plan is very out of date  what date is on the plan 
Contractor:,Chaotic Good, this is the plan we were given 
Me:,Chaotic Good, understood  but this design doesn t align with anything we ve discussed  what is the date on the plan 
Contractor:,Chaotic Good, march   th 
Me:,Chaotic Good,    it s october now  the updated plan has been available since september and is noted in the file with the date 
Contractor:,Chaotic Good, we can t be expected to keep track of what plans are the most current 
Client:,Chaotic Good, hi  how much does a brochure cost to print 
Client:,Chaotic Good, well  if you want to be that difficult i ll just find someone else   
Client: ,Chaotic Good,focusing on this one area would allow me to excel in that task  we ve found that giving too many other roles to people stretches them to thin 
Client:,Chaotic Good, now  i ve heard a number of proposals from you marketing people  so just let me know what you have to offer 
Client:,Chaotic Good, well  would you be able to update the website  provide content  partner with others  i m not naive to this you know  
Client:,Chaotic Good,  sneering i had a small agency working on my website  but they have other clients  so they couldn t help me as much as i would have liked  well  how would you create videos  how would you get people s permission  what about e mail campaigns  how would that work  
Client:,Chaotic Good, what about content  how would you write that  if i were to build out a team  who should i hire for the team  how about photos  what about partnerships  what s ppc  how about seo  you know  our competitors  they re all about the money  we actually care  what would your budget be for working on various projects 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i can t access my voicemail on my office phone 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,okay  are you getting any error message 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,yeah  i m entering the default passcode  but it s saying i need to use my id and hit pound 
Me:,Chaotic Good,    and have you tried that 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,no  why would i 
Me:,Chaotic Good, give it a try 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,now the phone is locked up  what the hell did you do  
Me: ,Chaotic Good,i can t access the phone in any way  ma am  did you enter your id and hit pound 
Client:,Chaotic Good, no  i entered the default passcode and then it locked up 
Me:,Chaotic Good, okay  i ll send a tech out  but i ll need to verify some information first 
Client:,Chaotic Good, why the hell do you need that  just fix my phone  asshole  i m not telling some asshole my personal information 
 Me: ,Chaotic Good, so you want to hire a marketer  great  why now  what are you trying to achieve

Me: ,Chaotic Good,wow  congratulations  that s exciting 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,yeah  i ve been involved in some previous projects that failed  so i m so glad this one is working out   
Client:,Chaotic Good, i have had some trouble with freelancers before  but i m finally at a point where i m ready to hire someone to manage my marketing plans 
Me:,Chaotic Good,    ok 
Client:,Chaotic Good, if i were to call your references  what would they say about you  what kinds of criticisms 
Me:,Chaotic Good, well  i don t know about criticisms  i think they would say that they enjoyed working with me and wished i had stayed longer with them 
Client:,Chaotic Good, what else  
Me:,Chaotic Good, uh    
 Me: ,Chaotic Good, what are you looking for  specifically 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,just follow your own vision  you will know best 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,this isn t what i wanted  can you just send me the raw footage 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,please let me know what you re after and i ll get to work on the changes 
Client:,Chaotic Good, we need a    x     banner printed by tomorrow  we have everything designed 
Me:,Chaotic Good, ok  just send over a full scale copy of the design in either a  tif or vector file and we should be fine 
Client:,Chaotic Good, when you say full scale  what do you mean  because we just have a few different logo files 
Me:,Chaotic Good, so the banner isn t designed 
Client:,Chaotic Good, well it s not designed per se  but it s really simple 
Me:,Chaotic Good, ok  here are the facebook posts  this is a starting point  let me know if you would like any edits 
Client:,Chaotic Good, great  thanks  i ll show the lead developer 
Client:,Chaotic Good, these posts aren t what we are looking for  the lead developer said he was looking for something else  we ll take it from here 
Client:,Chaotic Good, so  are you better than your friend 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i have great project coordinating skills  from communications to creating reports 
Client:,Chaotic Good, do you 
Me:,Chaotic Good, well  i used to  i was the captain of my soccer team in high school  that was fun 
Client:,Chaotic Good, do you have any personal issues i should know about 
Me:,Chaotic Good, um  no   i am simply seeking a new contract to hire role using my skills  knowledge  and experience 
Me:,Chaotic Good, we are just working on the contract changes  you ve asked us to add some information to the terms and conditions  but not specified where you want this  does this want to be a new section after section     or does it need inserting somewhere else 
Client:,Chaotic Good, yeah i knew you would be emailing me asking about that  haha 
Me:,Chaotic Good, are you looking to re brand 
Client:,Chaotic Good, oh no  i worked with another person on that and it was hell  i won t go down that road again 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i see  would you like me to work on the current look of your website  then 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i mostly need social media management  but you can work on my website  too  i currently have a marketing manager  but we are secretly looking to replace her  i need to engage a lot of people on social media 
Me:,Chaotic Good, ok  i could work on your social media pages 
Client:,Chaotic Good, look  i have a lot of applicants for this job  my main question is  what can you do for me 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i want this on my website 
Me:,Chaotic Good,  shrugs  then does as requested 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i don t like this  why can t you do your job properly 
Me:,Chaotic Good, how can i help you today 
Customer:,Chaotic Good, i need to speak with someone about a part that s not working in my hot tub that i bought from your store a year ago 
Me:,Chaotic Good, ok  just a moment  i ll connect you with the parts department 
Customer: ,Chaotic Good,the parts department said they don t answer those kinds of mechanical questions  they just order the parts 
Me:,Chaotic Good, oh  sorry about that  let me try the service department 
Customer:,Chaotic Good, now this is getting really annoying  the service department said they only answer pool service questions  not hot tub service questions 
Me:,Chaotic Good, wow  my apologies  sorry for the hassle  let me send you to the voicemail of the manager  he s busy at the moment  but can return your call soon  we ll get back to you about this as soon as possible 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i need you to work on your phone skills  the customer i just talked to on the phone was extremely annoyed that he had to talk to various departments about his hot tub part issue  i still need to find someone who can answer his question 
Me:,Chaotic Good, well  where was i supposed to send the phone call 
Manager: ,Chaotic Good,just send it to the 
Sales Associate:,Chaotic Good, yeah  we re supposed to know the answers to those questions  some of us know more than others about how those hot tubs work  i don t know if i know the answer to that particular issue though 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,try to keep on top of the team to use the project management system as much as possible  they re resistant but keep on them  
Client:,Chaotic Good, people don t like you 
Me:,Chaotic Good, what do you mean 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i have received a number of complaints from people in the office that you are asking them to use the project management system too much 
Me:,Chaotic Good, that s what you asked me to do  i guess i won t communicate as much 
Client:,Chaotic Good, that won t work either  i need you to be more likable 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i need you to create an e mail campaign template and a poster for one of my clients 
Me:,Chaotic Good, ok  do you have any specific colors  fonts  or imagery that you would like me to use 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i created this brief guide based on the existing creative work and logo of the client  this will help us keep things organized and on brand with projects  we can adjust it as needed as we go 
Client:,Chaotic Good, wow  great idea  i have been working with this client for over a year with various designers and i never thought to specify the colors  fonts  or overall direction of the projects 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i just wanted to let you know we re moving out of town  so we re leaving the management up to the team at the office 
Me:,Chaotic Good, ok  thanks for letting me know 
Client:,Chaotic Good, we feel like we left out baby behind  can you send us an e mail from time to time to let us know how things are going at the office  thanks 
Me:,Chaotic Good, it seems like there s a lot of work that we need to do to market this expanded product line 
Client’s son:,Chaotic Good, well  i ve only been here a year  what do you want me to do about it 
Me:,Chaotic Good, there is a customer waiting to speak to a salesperson  but no one is available 
Sales Manager:,Chaotic Good, well  what questions does he have 
Me:,Chaotic Good, various questions  he said it s important that he gets the right answers from someone experienced with the products 
Sales Manager:,Chaotic Good, i can t help him  i don t know enough about those products to answer his questions  i haven t answered customer questions about these products in years  and i hardly leave my office  you will have to find another salesperson  can you write down his questions in the meantime 
Client (Director of Marketing):,Chaotic Good, i am so proud of how well we are doing on this project  thank you for all of your hard work  the owner of the business is very pleased 
Mom and Dad: ,Chaotic Good,oh thank god  you re keeping your job  you ll have a 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,can you take on this additional project 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,i could  but to do anything more i would need to be paid 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,i m writing with regards to your so called  designer  who  helped  me the other day who clearly has inadequate experience to do the job  they should be fired 
.,Chaotic Good,none
Client:,Chaotic Good, i need this logo you designed me for my zip seal tea product to be smaller  i don t want to pay the printer that much 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,did you want to change the materials of  the stickers or print direct onto the packet instead of stickers 
Client:,Chaotic Good, no i need the matte stickers i specified  just make them to size of your thumb instead  i can print that and stick it on to my bags of tea myself     g and  kg packets of loose leaf tea  
Me:,Chaotic Good, i would advise against that as the customer will need to squint to see the logo and will not be able to see the logo properly from the aisle 
Client:,Chaotic Good, why is that  seems quite logical to me  why would they squint 
Me:,Chaotic Good, should i send a pdf tutorial explaining 
Client:,Chaotic Good, well all right  you seem to not be able to make sense on the matter 
Me,Chaotic Good,   i sent a pdf with pictures i captured of me in supermarket aisles comparing the products i could identify clearly from walking and compared to my thumb size 
Client:,Chaotic Good, ahhhh  ok well that makes sense  i guess i ll have to pay for the original size then 
Clients wife:,Chaotic Good, my husband wants to know why you have charged him an extra     than what was quoted 
Clients wife:,Chaotic Good,  yelling at her husband while still on the phone to me
),Chaotic Good, 
Client's wife:,Chaotic Good,  to me  don t worry i ll pay you myself  
Me: ,Chaotic Good,i m available on that day  however  given the number of subjects that d be involved my rate will be higher than last time  your last shoot was      but this will be        is that all right 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,i m sorry  but i m booked for that day  i tried following up with you several times and received no response so i assumed you weren t interested  
Me: ,Chaotic Good,you didn t even call me to cancel the shoot 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,there must be something wrong with my email server 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,er    what s this  it looks like our advert but it s been amended 
Manager:,Chaotic Good, yeah  the client s head of marketing convinced him to go with a freelancer for this based on your concept  they paid      
Me: ,Chaotic Good,but it barely looks any different 
Manager: ,Chaotic Good, shrug 
Agency: ,Chaotic Good,the client found out that the font we used will cost a license fee  they will not pay it  use an googlefont instead 
Client:,Chaotic Good, my designer is a 
Me:,Chaotic Good, o o
Client:,Chaotic Good, why is my 
Me:,Chaotic Good, what french version 
Client:,Chaotic Good, it s in the proposal and initial brief we provided 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i can t see it anywhere  also  you asked us to re do this proposal   times to meet your requirements and a french version never came up  
Client:,Chaotic Good, are you calling me a liar  i want the french website at no additional cost 
Me:,Chaotic Good, ok  i can design these 
Client:,Chaotic Good, that s great  go ahead and design in a format we can copy and paste from outlook 
Me:,Chaotic Good, here are the emails in outlook  i ve also included html files as most email systems support this  i m not familiar with the system you re using so please let me know if you need them in a different format 
Client:,Chaotic Good, these are perfect  thank you 
Client:,Chaotic Good, the format isn t compatible  this isn t going to work  don t bother fixing it  
Me: ,Chaotic Good,i tried to accommodate based on the information i had  what system are you working with  can i try putting it in directly  
Client:,Chaotic Good, i haven t received any emails since the website went live yesterday  i told you to be careful with our emails when migrating the site to the new platform and now my office is at a standstill 
Me:,Chaotic Good, let me look into it 
Client:,Chaotic Good, don t worry about it  my pc was just running slow because i ve been out of the office for a day
Client: ,Chaotic Good,i really just want that one image you showed us 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,unfortunately  that s not a logo  that was just an example file that came with the font  i shared it with you to give a general sense of the design  i can t just use that  
Client: ,Chaotic Good,well  it s what i want  i don t even want to see anything else  
Me:,Chaotic Good, you mean the meeting where i thought i was having a stroke 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,yes 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,i wasn t really mentally present  as i m sure you can understand  and you ve not mentioned it to me since 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,when i ask you to do something i expect to see it done 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,i understand that  but you asked me to do this during a meeting when i was having a stroke 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,that s not a good enough excuse  if you d been working with me longer i might understand  but you ve only been on this project a few weeks 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,how long do i have to have been working with you for it to be okay for me to have a stroke during a meeting 
Client:,Chaotic Good, why are you not designing the website 
Me:,Chaotic Good, you haven t told me anything about what you want  what will this website be  where is the content  what should it include  who is visiting the site 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,you can design a site without content 
Client:,Chaotic Good, well then  it seems we are at an impasse  
Client:,Chaotic Good, when you finished the 
Me:,Chaotic Good, you gave your okay and told me to submit them to the person that is in charge of site content  you even 
Client:,Chaotic Good, but don t you know that stuff like this normally goes through a process 
Me:,Chaotic Good, you mean  staging  
Client:,Chaotic Good, yes  that  why didn t you just do that 
Me:,Chaotic Good, because you don t have any staging  that s how your websites were built  that s why everything goes live as soon as it s submitted for site content 
Client:,Chaotic Good, here are some photos of 
Client:,Chaotic Good, uum   these don t look  techy  enough 
Me:,Chaotic Good, those are the photos you gave me  what do you want to be changed  
Client:,Chaotic Good, can you maybe make us look more professional  more tech focused 
Me:,Chaotic Good,    how 
Client:,Chaotic Good, here are some photos of our chief investors  digitally insert them into the previous ones  make them look like they re really in our nairobi office with us 
Client:,Chaotic Good, oh  and can you make their eyes blue and their hair a little blonde  please 
Client:,Chaotic Good, we have hired someone new who will be coming in soon to work on marketing with you 
Me:,Chaotic Good, ok  thanks for letting me know 
Client:,Chaotic Good, here s a residential project that needs to be added to the website  i don t have the text in a word document  kindly let me know if you can work with it 
Me:,Chaotic Good, yes  i can work with the text  it ll just take a little longer to type out  do you have photos for the project 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i still don t have any photos for the project  obviously  photos will showcase the project better than text can on its own  i can create a page without photos but to sell the project it would be better if people can see how it would look 
Client:,Chaotic Good, add the project to the website with just the text 
Client:,Chaotic Good, this is a total disaster  you ve printed all these stickers with the wrong date on them  it should be   th october as per the email below  i am very annoyed that you can t follow a simple instruction 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i m sorry for the error  i ll fix that right away  just to check though  your email says   st october  we do have a sign off procedure and that is the date you signed off on 
Client:,Chaotic Good, well i didn t read it when i signed it off  i m a key account holder  i m too important to check details like that 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i really want the 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i think we ll go with option  x   reduce the vibrancy of the background as we feel our logo is getting lost 
Client:,Chaotic Good, great  let s send this to print 
Client:,Chaotic Good, the billboard looks awful  the background color doesn t stand out  please re do it 
Father: ,Chaotic Good,i have a business idea  how hard is it to 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,oh  very easy 
Daughter: ,Chaotic Good,he doesn t mean to make a facebook profile  he means to re make all of facebook 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,oh  very hard 
Father: ,Chaotic Good,oh  okay 
Dad,Chaotic Good,  i m kind of the creative of the bunch at work 
Me,Chaotic Good,  really  that s awesome  i do a lot of that for my clients at the end of the year too 
Dad,Chaotic Good,  yea  i really like working with the fonts  my favorite is one that i just found  called 
Me,Chaotic Good,  that s great dad  good find 
Client:,Chaotic Good, hi  the margin between the logo and the content is wrong  can you simply change it while i m on the phone 
Me:,Chaotic Good, sure  did you want the margin to be bigger or smaller 
Client:,Chaotic Good, can you increase it about by     
Me:,Chaotic Good, sure  how s that 
Client:,Chaotic Good, no  that s not right  it s too much  can you decrease it slightly 
Me:,Chaotic Good, sure  how s that for you 
Client:,Chaotic Good, 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,thanks mate  i designed the logos and cartoons myself   start to finish 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i m having trouble with the pee dee file  i ve used them before  but this one isn t working 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i m sorry  the what 
Client:,Chaotic Good, the pee dee file  it won t open up 
Me:,Chaotic Good, the pedophile 
Client:,Chaotic Good, no  no  no  the pee dee file 
Me:,Chaotic Good, does the file end with a 
Client:,Chaotic Good, yes  that s it 
Me:,Chaotic Good,  thats a pdf  pee dee eff 
Client:,Chaotic Good,  oh  okay  that s probably why google wasn t helping  
Me: ,Chaotic Good,cock adjusted 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,that s nice  did you get a chance to update the countdown on the site though 
Client:,Chaotic Good, now we can discuss what i really wanted 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,what about 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i just made that up to see how you would react 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i want the site in multicolor 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i can do that  but i think that it would turn out horrible 
Client:,Chaotic Good, just kidding  i was making sure that you d stop me if i ever suggested something like that  i m emailing the brief now 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i need you to 
Me:,Chaotic Good, sorry  i m closing up 
Client:,Chaotic Good, but i m here 
Me:,Chaotic Good,   and 
Client:,Chaotic Good, you have to help me if i m here 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i ll pay you double 
Client:,Chaotic Good, yes  that s it  that s the one  the boss will love it 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i d like to schedule a time to film your testimonial 
Client:,Chaotic Good, next tuesday at      am or      am would be great 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i m busy during the days this next week  except for after     pm on monday or wednesday 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i m free      am to     pm on monday  
Me:,Chaotic Good, this brief is awesome  but there are a couple typos that i think may be misconstrued  do i have permission to make a couple tweaks to it 
Client:,Chaotic Good, no  think of my brief as a strip club  look but don t touch  thanks  
Client:,Chaotic Good, i really like the patterns of the fabrics you have chosen and i would like to 
Client:,Chaotic Good, or  best case  his accordion 
Client:,Chaotic Good, this is great  i love the background 
Me:,Chaotic Good, that background s transparent 
Client:,Chaotic Good, checkered  transparent  whatever   i like it 
Client:,Chaotic Good, while i love  love  love the new indesign plug in  i noticed that the icon that populates my deck doesn t reflect our branding  the colors should be updated  also  we want a more updated icon than a scroll   i attached our brand icons for you  oh  and the name should reflect the brand as well   rather than extendscript toolkit 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i appreciate the thorough response  but extendscript toolkit is the name of adobe s script debugger  it only shows in your dock when there s an error to report  
Client:,Chaotic Good, can t you just 
Me:,Chaotic Good, the background won t scan very well  and there s some text on top of it  can you tell me what these formulas represent  i should be able to find some suitable images in order to recreate them 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i don t know what they are  it s really not that important what they are  i just need cards by wednesday so i look like i know what i m doing 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,oh  i have something to email you  
Me: ,Chaotic Good, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post            budget meeting with the client who wants to know  can you just tell me   a 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,we re going to go a bit farther   we want more options  
Me: ,Chaotic Good,i m sorry  i don t understand  
Client: ,Chaotic Good,we want the child to be beaten more 
Client: ,Chaotic Good, shouting  beat the kid more 
Client:,Chaotic Good, so when you were away  the girl i talked to said it would be much easier for your people to do the typesetting 
Me:,Chaotic Good, that s great  but it would be much better if you could just email us the word file  so you won t have to pay for us typing it all out again 
Client:,Chaotic Good, oh  you re brilliant  i knew you would come up with great ideas  that s why you re in this business 
Client:,Chaotic Good, i love it    go for it       more belly   less boob       
Client:,Chaotic Good, actually  
Client: ,Chaotic Good,do you guys accept chocolate  flowers  coffee  or happy hour coupons  
Me: ,Chaotic Good,uh  
Client: ,Chaotic Good,oh  i know  i just think i need to give you an extra treat for dealing with all this crap 
’,Chaotic Good,

’,Chaotic Good,t like any of them  
’,Chaotic Good,t like any of them 
’,Chaotic Good, 
’,Chaotic Good,t like any of them 
’,Chaotic Good,t like any of them 
’,Chaotic Good,t change a thing  just use this as it is  
’,Chaotic Good,t just steal some other company
’,Chaotic Good,s logo  there would be legal consequences 
’,Chaotic Good,t get busted  
’,Chaotic Good,ll send you some variations on that theme  
’,Chaotic Good,t really like the colours   he said   can we try some other colours  
’,Chaotic Good,s not blue and grey  
’,Chaotic Good,s enthusiastic  friendly  and is paying me  handsomely  as we go along  he
’,Chaotic Good,s just an idiot  at least with angry clients who disagree with you  the scenario can end anytime with a slammed down phone  but this is the client who won
’,Chaotic Good,t go away  won
’,Chaotic Good,t listen to a word of advice  and i can
’,Chaotic Good,t afford to fire him  after the logo  he wants a website  at least if he gives me an aneurysm  i ll be able to afford it  
Me:,Chaotic Good, what aspect of the site do you like here 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,the women  
Me:,Chaotic Good, i don t think it would be appropriate for your work site  
Client: ,Chaotic Good,god no  none of these sites have anything you could use for my work site  
Me:,Chaotic Good, then why did you send them 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,i thought we were 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,if you 
Client:,Chaotic Good, okay  i ll send them tomorrow first class 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,first class 
Client:,Chaotic Good, yeah  i ll put them on a memory stick tonight and put it in the post first thing tomorrow
Client: ,Chaotic Good,the writeup looks great  but maybe you can dial it back a little  
Me:,Chaotic Good, okay  i can make the changes to the text  what about the images 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,oh yes  the guy looks too happy  can you make his expression more neutral  we don t want people to have too much expectations 
Me:,Chaotic Good, alright  but that s the only image you provided  
Client: ,Chaotic Good,i don t mind if you photoshop it  just less happiness in general 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,i love it  so how do we make this a logo to start putting on things  take a high res picture and save it as an rtf or something 
Client:,Chaotic Good, do you put stuff on the seat of benches 
Me:,Chaotic Good, you mean apply decals to them 
Client:,Chaotic Good, yeah  you know   print stuff on the seat of the bench 
Me:,Chaotic Good, i would have to check to make sure  what kind of an ad were you looking for 
Client:,Chaotic Good, well  it s not an ad  exactly 
Me:,Chaotic Good, what is it 
Client:,Chaotic Good, 
Me:,Chaotic Good,  
Client:,Chaotic Good, so every time i sit down  she can kiss my ass 
Me: ,Chaotic Good, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post             client so unlimited calling how many minutes is  how many  a 
Client: ,Chaotic Good,well  they d be probably be watching it on their laptops  so one  maybe two 
Me: ,Chaotic Good,not at one time 
Me:,Chaotic Good, the beach looks wonderful  we ll really have to highlight the appeal of swimming in the sea  
Client:,Chaotic Good, for sure  it s pretty  but we ll want to downplay actually swimming in it 
Me:,Chaotic Good, why s that 
Client:,Chaotic Good, since purchasing the land  we discovered that the sea water at the beach flows from the antarctic  so it s ice cold  
Me:,Chaotic Good, oh  that s no good  still   
Client:,Chaotic Good,  which tends to attract sharks  
Client:,Chaotic Good, i d like a spark to travel down the shaft and explode when it gets to the tip  
Client:,Dunces, i received my desktop from the company but when my son was here to help me put it together he said there was a part missing so it won t turn on 
Me:,Dunces, was it the power cord 
Client:,Dunces, you re going to have to be less technically with me  i have no idea what that is 
Me:,Dunces, the cord that plugs into your power outlet 
Client:,Dunces, look  i m not a  computer wizard  like you  i don t know what you re talking about 
Me:,Dunces, okay  it s the same type of cord that would be attached to a lamp that you plug into the wall so that it comes on  is there one of those coming out of the computer and into the wall 
Client:,Dunces, this is getting nowhere  can i speak to your supervisor 
Client:,Dunces, see  it isn t working 
Me:,Dunces, ok  let me take a look  what s your user name and password 
Client:,Dunces, i don t know  that s why it isn t working 
Other worker:,Dunces, hey boss remember  we set all of our user names to our first name  and the password is our last name 
Client:,Dunces, huh  i guess it is working  ok  i guess we didn t need you after all 
Client:,Dunces, you were speeding  we had to catch up to you several times 
Me:,Dunces, no  i made sure to set the cruise control at exactly the speed limit 
Client: ,Dunces,yeah  but your engine is bigger than ours 
Me:,Dunces,   haha   huh    ha  wait  are you serious 
Me:,Dunces, you need to bring two forms of id to take your test 
Client:,Dunces, nobody said that  i only have one 
Me:,Dunces, it s in your confirmation e mail  which you printed out and brought with you 
Client:,Dunces, well yeah  but i don t have time to read that stuff 
Me:,Dunces, so what are you looking for 
Client:,Dunces, yeah  so what dpi can you take pictures at 
Client:,Dunces, i need this website translated into french 
Me:,Dunces, can you provide all the contents in a word format 
Client:,Dunces, this is all i have  hope this helps 
Client:,Dunces, you built my website  and i need changes 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry  but you will need to contact my ex husband  he is the sole owner now 
Client:,Dunces, no  i want you do it 
Me:,Dunces, i haven t worked on websites in over    years  i wouldn t know where to start building one today 
Client:,Dunces, that s impossible  the internet hasn t even been around for    years  
Me:,Dunces, hey i emailed you a week ago requesting you approve a facebook ad  you might not have gotten it 
Me: ,Dunces,here s the link for you to approve  please let me know  also  please confirm you ve received this email  
Client:,Dunces, your emails are coming through my spam 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry about that 
Me:,Dunces, please green list us and that should fix the issue  did you see the ad  what did you think 
Client:,Dunces,  no response  ever 
Client: ,Dunces, i m sorry  but the search feature on  our intranet site  is terrible   i can t find anything 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry to hear that  can you give me an example of what you re trying to find 
Client:,Dunces, well  i m trying to find the address for my dentist  but when i put his name in nothing comes up 
Me:,Dunces, erm  the intranet site search is for finding documents that we use internally   i think you are confusing it with a search engine  like google 
Client:,Dunces, well  that s just stupid  what good is a search feature if it doesn t give me what i m looking for 
Me:,Dunces, nothing needs changing 
Client:,Dunces, no  it s good  will it be ready tomorrow 
Me:,Dunces, i can get it finished by then 
Client:,Dunces, great 
Client:,Dunces, actually we can only have three colors 
Me:,Dunces,    okay  i ll change it 
Client:,Dunces, and i think this could be a different colour 
Me:,Dunces, okay 
Client:,Dunces, and you need to take the background out 
Me:,Dunces, it s transparent 
Client:,Dunces, we want to print it on black hoodies 
Me:,Dunces, that will work  it s transparent 
Client:,Dunces, it s white there 
Me:,Dunces, if we printed it on black paper that would be black  if you put it on a black background it would be black 
Client:,Dunces, so it will be black 
Me:,Dunces, yes 
Client:,Dunces, the picture is really blurry and pixelated  you need to fix it 
Me:,Dunces, re download it from the email i sent you 
Client:,Dunces, did you fix it 
Me:,Dunces, re download it from the email i sent you 
Client:,Dunces, i received my desktop from the company but when my son was here to help me put it together he said there was a part missing so it won t turn on 
Me:,Dunces, was it the power cord 
Client:,Dunces, you re going to have to be less technically with me  i have no idea what that is 
Me:,Dunces, the cord that plugs into your power outlet 
Client:,Dunces, look  i m not a  computer wizard  like you  i don t know what you re talking about 
Me:,Dunces, okay  it s the same type of cord that would be attached to a lamp that you plug into the wall so that it comes on  is there one of those coming out of the computer and into the wall 
Client:,Dunces, this is getting nowhere  can i speak to your supervisor 
Client:,Dunces, see  it isn t working 
Me:,Dunces, ok  let me take a look  what s your user name and password 
Client:,Dunces, i don t know  that s why it isn t working 
Other worker:,Dunces, hey boss remember  we set all of our user names to our first name  and the password is our last name 
Client:,Dunces, huh  i guess it is working  ok  i guess we didn t need you after all 
Client:,Dunces, you were speeding  we had to catch up to you several times 
Me:,Dunces, no  i made sure to set the cruise control at exactly the speed limit 
Client: ,Dunces,yeah  but your engine is bigger than ours 
Me:,Dunces,   haha   huh    ha  wait  are you serious 
Me:,Dunces, you need to bring two forms of id to take your test 
Client:,Dunces, nobody said that  i only have one 
Me:,Dunces, it s in your confirmation e mail  which you printed out and brought with you 
Client:,Dunces, well yeah  but i don t have time to read that stuff 
Me:,Dunces, so what are you looking for 
Client:,Dunces, yeah  so what dpi can you take pictures at

Client:,Dunces, you built my website  and i need changes 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry  but you will need to contact my ex husband  he is the sole owner now 
Client:,Dunces, no  i want you do it 
Me:,Dunces, i haven t worked on websites in over    years  i wouldn t know where to start building one today 
Client:,Dunces, that s impossible  the internet hasn t even been around for    years  
Me:,Dunces, hey i emailed you a week ago requesting you approve a facebook ad  you might not have gotten it 
Me: ,Dunces,here s the link for you to approve  please let me know  also  please confirm you ve received this email  
Client:,Dunces, your emails are coming through my spam 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry about that 
Me:,Dunces, please green list us and that should fix the issue  did you see the ad  what did you think 
Client:,Dunces,  no response  ever 
Client: ,Dunces, i m sorry  but the search feature on  our intranet site  is terrible   i can t find anything 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry to hear that  can you give me an example of what you re trying to find 
Client:,Dunces, well  i m trying to find the address for my dentist  but when i put his name in nothing comes up 
Me:,Dunces, erm  the intranet site search is for finding documents that we use internally   i think you are confusing it with a search engine  like google

Client:,Dunces, and i think this could be a different colour 
Me:,Dunces, okay 
Client:,Dunces, and you need to take the background out 
Me:,Dunces, it s transparent 
Client:,Dunces, we want to print it on black hoodies 
Me:,Dunces, that will work  it s transparent 
Client:,Dunces, it s white there 
Me:,Dunces, if we printed it on black paper that would be black  if you put it on a black background it would be black 
Client:,Dunces, so it will be black 
Me:,Dunces, yes

Me:,Dunces, re download it from the email i sent you 
Client: ,Dunces,we d like the meetings to be in the afternoon of  th  
Me: ,Dunces,i m sorry  but that s not possible  because of time zone differences    pm there would be midnight here  also  the  th is our independence day  so no one would be attending that meeting since it s a public holiday 
Client:,Dunces, what   do you think i m that stupid  independence day is the  th of july  not the  th of december  
Me,Dunces,   
Client: ,Dunces,we need the control panel for our emails back but they won t give it to us 
Me:,Dunces, who 
Client: ,Dunces,i want to create any mail without asking anyone  we need to take the data from them and put it here 
Me:,Dunces, we can t do that  sorry but it doesn t work like that  also  i m not sure who  they  are 
Client:,Dunces, if i own our domain name  then i should be able to make emails with that domain 
 Me ,Dunces,you don t own the domain  you re licensing it 
Client: ,Dunces,so  who does own our domain  is  com the owner 
Me: ,Dunces,huh 
Client:,Dunces,  com must be the real owner  i ll talk to them 
Client:,Dunces, what color is the logo 
Me:,Dunces, it s blue 
Client:,Dunces, what is 
Client:,Dunces, can you provide me the permalinks for the 
Me:,Dunces, sure  here you go 
Client:,Dunces, hmm  based on how these are performing  we want to stop running on there  can you turn them off 
Me:,Dunces, sure  those ad placements have been removed 
Client:,Dunces, hey  those permalinks you sent to us for the instagram ads aren t working  we keep getting a      can you send new links 
Me:,Dunces,  that s because i turned them off 
Client: ,Dunces,there are just too many errors for me to even begin  please stop all work as i ve hired a new developer who gets me and has better communication  please 
Me: ,Dunces,here  in the spa etiquette section   it still asks guests to  silence or turn off their 
Me:,Dunces, roughly the year        outside of the first responder and medical emergency communities pagers are basically considered retro tech  like palm pilots 
Me:,Dunces,    
Client: ,Dunces,remove our website    if people google us  they will find our web site  also  remove the year from the date  and nix the logo 
Client: ,Dunces,hey  how much does it cost per poster to print them 
Me: ,Dunces,well  it depends on how many you need  it could be as much as       per poster  for    of them   or as little as      per poster  for      of them 
Me:,Dunces, okay  that s a little tricky with our printer  they don t price for that number  i could order   x  posters  for       or i could do     posters for       which is only     more for     extra posters 
Client:,Dunces, what  how is that possible  i m not comfortable making that decision  i m going to hand this over to the steering committee 
Me:,Dunces, i noticed your business cards are in spanish   that s kind of a bad look in brazil  honestly  it would be like coming to sweden with danish materials  if you want  i m a native portugese speaker  i could translate them free of charge 
Client: ,Dunces,no thanks  portuguese and spanish are basically the same thing  
Client: ,Dunces,my computer at home probably has a virus or something  so the new website doesn t load properly  can you change the website so it will load properly 
Client:,Dunces, so one thing we noticed is that when the screen reader highlights the  close  button  it obscures it  we think people using screen readers will find this inconvenient  
Me:,Dunces,  so you re saying that people who use screen readers won t be able to see the close button 
Client:,Dunces, correct 
Me:,Dunces, and  just to clarify  we are assuming that people who are using the screen readers are blind 
Client:,Dunces, yep 
Me:,Dunces, i don t think blind people will have an issue with not being able to seen something on the screen 
Client:,Dunces,  right  
Client:,Dunces, i have tried to fiddle with the system according to your provided manual  could you elaborate on this point on how do i input mac address here  what format do i need to use 
had tried,Dunces, at all 
Client: ,Dunces,can you  like  convert a jpg to html  
Client:,Dunces, this traffic increase happened naturally as the economy grew by     it has nothing to do with your work  
Me:,Dunces, i don t think that overall economic growth can be directly impacting your rankings  you re getting more visitors because we improved your rankings  
Client:,Dunces, it does  do you know there are         babies born every month  
Me:,Dunces, i don t think they google  
Client:,Dunces, are these portrait or landscape 
Me:,Dunces, they re squares 
Client:,Dunces, there are   dots above the word  sensitivities  in this design  what are they doing there 
Me:,Dunces, those are the dots on the  i s 
Me:,Dunces, well  it s a photo and it has edges  the photo ends  that s all that was photographed in the room 
Me:,Dunces, i would have to travel back in time to this shoot  which occurred   years ago  and ask the photographer to photograph the entire room  which obviously i cannot  
Me:,Dunces, this new text says       november        and you misstated the name of the official sponsoring organization as  sponsored official organization  
Client:,Dunces, please do the following correction
Client:,Dunces, i talked to a pentest provider  they say you should ask your host s permission before commissioning the test  can you check if pentests are allowed 
Me:,Dunces,  after checking  no  my current host does not allow pentests and would suspend the account  i will need to move the web app to a new host  it will cost  x and i can do it at the weekend to avoid disruption  can you give me the go ahead to do that 
Client:,Dunces, oh by the way i arranged the pentest  it s being done tomorrow  do we still need to move the site 
Me:,Dunces,     
Me,Dunces, why have you brought that router and the power and ethernet cables 
Client: ,Dunces,so i could get on the internet and show you guys the site during the meeting 
Me: ,Dunces,this is the third time this year your site s been hacked  your plugins are old and unsupported and need updates and the whole thing is just a sitting duck  i ve fixed the problem but you need to update 
Client: ,Dunces,fine  i ll take care of it 
Me: ,Dunces,obviously you re free to shop around  but if you wanted us to rebuild the site with our system we could remove those vulnerabilities and improve seo and all that  i think you d find it a real improvement  
Client: ,Dunces,thanks  nowadays people can build their own sites easily for free just as good  with the tools online 
Client: ,Dunces,i need you to design some cards 
Me: ,Dunces,what size 
Me:,Dunces, okay  everything is completed now  i see that you accepted domain transfer few days ago and now i have confirmed that the website migration is completed  here is your wordpress login information 
Client:,Dunces, i can see the website but your installer placed it in the wrong folder so it cant work 
Me:,Dunces, thanks for confirming that the website is up and working  not sure what you mean by the wrong folder  the mysql database and website files were all placed in the correct order places  etc 
Client:,Dunces, i couldn t reach you on sunday after the files were put in wrong folder  so i tried to reset passwords to move them  you did not reply to me on sunday so i had to hire a developer  he says he has to change the password so you can t log in and screw up the website  he says it s good you left a zip file there or the whole website would be gone  anyway  my developer is reinstalling everything for me  the files  the database and the mysql stuff was old as well  no need to talk to him  he s overseas anyway  i found him through upwork  no he s not creating issues but just for some strange reason couldn t change the wp admin login credentials   
Me:,Dunces, as i stated the website was working fine yesterday  it s alarming that the developer you hired changed the passwords  i can t give you advice if i can t log in now  
Client: ,Dunces,when you clicked on the domain in cpanel under the domain  there was no long list of files that showed that are supposed to  just   files  a backup of the website  two favicon files  the cgibin file  and one other file that had nothing in it  there s supposed to be like    files showing when you click on it  then wp content  wp admin  etc  there was none of this  so this goes to show the migration was done very wrong  
Me:,Dunces, as i have already stated  the website and mysql were moved and everything was up and visible online  if i can t login to view the cpanel or wordpress  there s not much more i can write here   
Me:,Dunces,    
Client:,Dunces, please note that this is also my banking credentials  so please don t use it for that 
Me:,Dunces, uhm   i would not have known that if you did not tell me 
Client:,Dunces, oh   okay but just don t use it 
Me:,Dunces,    
Client:,Dunces, please add a column x to the spreadsheet and i will put in the data in there 
Me:,Dunces, here is the spreadsheet with a column x for you to add the data 
Me:,Dunces, do you have the data yet 
Client:,Dunces, here it is 
Me:,Dunces, there s no data in column x 
Client:,Dunces, was i supposed to fill in that column  i didn t know what it was for 
Me:,Dunces, no problem  send me the content i ll set it out for you ready for print 
Me:,Dunces, how s this 
Client:,Dunces, bigger again  it needs to be the biggest thing on the menu  all my years in marketing has taught me that the logo needs to be huge 
Me:,Dunces, but then it will take away all proportion to the text and look hideous 
Client:,Dunces, do it anyway then go to print 
Dev:,Dunces, you are missing sms and push notification content  please add the copy for sms and push into your document 
Me:,Dunces, those aren t a requirement for this alert and i was told not to add them  please proceed with just email 
Dev:,Dunces, please add the copy for sms and push into your document 
Me:,Dunces, this isn t sent yet  as previously mentioned  we are only supposed to write for email  i have cc d the client  who has made it clear that we are only to write for email 
Client:,Dunces, yes  this is true  please proceed with the email 
Dev:,Dunces, please add the copy for sms and push into your document 
Me:,Dunces, we have reviewed this several times now  and the client has made it very clear we are not to write for email  please either consult your team on the requirements or proceed with email 
Client:,Dunces, confirming the above  please proceed with email only   no changes to the copy document needed 
Dev:,Dunces, ok 
Dev:,Dunces, please remove the copy for sms and push from your document 
Me:,Dunces, uh    
Me:,Dunces,  no problem  that s just bar chimes  we already have those 
Me:,Dunces,   mark tree  is the official orchestral term for bar chimes  really  they re the same thing  a mark tree is a set of bar chimes  this studio has two sets of them  and i even have a set of my own  we have everything we need 
Client:,Dunces,    
Me:,Dunces,    
Client: ,Dunces,you don t understand  it s about consistency 
 Client: ,Dunces, if i give you a black and white copy  could you xerox it in color 
Client:,Dunces, how much will this animation cost 
Me:,Dunces, it depends on the complexity  could you show me the character you want to animate 
Client:,Dunces, bro chill  why are you acting like an architect  i just want the price bro 
Me:,Dunces, i can t give you the price without knowing what you want  do you go into a mcdonalds and ask  what s the price  before ordering anything 
Client:,Dunces, you re weirding me out not gonna lie  why would you ask to see the character before giving me the price  you trying to steal my character 
Me:,Dunces, so here s the new ipa file 
Client: ,Dunces,ok  will do 
Client:,Dunces, it won t open 
Me:,Dunces, what do you mean it won t open 
Client: ,Dunces,i tried to open the app and it just doesn t open 
Me: ,Dunces,i ve checked over everything  installed it on multiple devices here  done upgrades from one version to another and it seems fine  what are you doing exactly 
Client:,Dunces, just trying to open it  keeps showing an error 
Me: ,Dunces,ah  ok  can you screenshot and send me the error  
Client:,Dunces, i m trying to publish a newsletter but i can t find my site 
Me:,Dunces, it says the ip address is unavailable 
Client:,Dunces, he can t take the website down  that s illegal 
Me:,Dunces, you haven t paid him for the past few months and you ve hired a new social media marketer to redo the crm he made 
Client:,Dunces, all of our things are on there  i m pretty sure that s illegal 
Client: ,Dunces,how do i log in to google analytics 
Me:,Dunces, here s an example of my work  
Client:,Dunces, i love it  can you send me a copy 
Me:,Dunces,  completely flabbergasted 
Client:,Dunces, great  so we ll use hosting company yyyy instead of company xxxx 
Me:,Dunces, yes  that s what i recommend 
Me:,Dunces, did you take down your old website 
Client:,Dunces, no  i transferred the old domain to the new hosting site you recommended  you mean the website wouldn t be transferred with it 
Me:,Dunces, no  that s a separate process  do you have a backup of your old website 
Client:,Dunces, no 
Client:,Dunces, now  why would i want a wordpress site  those are free and so basic   he says with a sneer  
Me:,Dunces, i was describing a highly customized wordpress site  which is different 
Client: ,Dunces,well  for now  let s just work on updating the website i had made   years ago  the developer coded it all himself  see if you can reach out to him to find out more about where to access the files 
Me:,Dunces, oh  the links aren t working  so leads can t inquire in those areas and customers can t view some of the products 
Client:,Dunces, why would that be  why isn t my site working 
Client:,Dunces, how do i get rid of this e mail from this guy  he keeps showing up in my inbox 
Me:,Dunces, have you tried deleting it or flagging it as spam 
Client:,Dunces, no  how do i do those things 
Me:,Dunces, how are things going so far at the dealership 
Client:,Dunces, not well  sales have been down  and we re financially struggling  i don t have time to do any marketing 
Me:,Dunces, that s not good  i did some online research  and it looks like there are a lot of very negative reviews on google and facebook about the dealership  that s likely hurting sales  have you seen them 
Client:,Dunces, no  let me check 
Client:,Dunces, wow  here s a horrible review from two years ago  this is the first time i ve heard of this 
Me:,Dunces, take a look at them all  it s helpful to respond to negative and positive reviews in a timely fashion if possible 
Client:,Dunces, why would i need to do that 
Me:,Dunces, have you tried paid online advertising for your dealership 
Client:,Dunces, no  how does that work 
Me:,Dunces, we could use google sheets to coordinate tasks for now  and maybe use a more sophisticated project management system later 
Client:,Dunces, how do we use google sheets 
Me:,Dunces, it s from google  similar to excel  but you can access it from your gmail account  i can send you some instructions 
Client:,Dunces, i used to have a gmail account  but my friend used my iphone a year ago  so now whenever i try to see my e mail i see hers instead 
One of the Client's employees:,Dunces, i don t know if i have a gmail account either  i ll have to check  do i just sign up for one 
Client:,Dunces, i think there s
Me:,Dunces, that would be weird  i haven t heard of that one before  let me see 
Me:,Dunces, oh  you mean the ad 
Client:,Dunces, yes  how do we get rid of that  maybe this will work 
Me:,Dunces, i completed online classes in website development and the user experience  i have taken classes in computer science and i know a number of programming languages 
Client:,Dunces, why would you need to study that  what a waste of time  these days most websites are drag and drop 
Client:,Dunces, you created the wrong email addresses 
Me:,Dunces, oh  i am looking at the email you sent  i created the emails with the exact handles you requested 
Client:,Dunces, i need the emails to be  client   shorteneddomain com   not  client   reallylongdomainnamethatsheowns com 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry  but that s not the domain that you purchased 
Client:,Dunces, this has nothing to do with my domain  my domain is correct  the emails are wrong  
Me:,Dunces, you cannot make any email address you want  it doesn t work like that  you need to own the domain you are using for the email addresses  
Client:,Dunces,  now enraged  why would you even agree to create emails with such a long domain  this is unacceptable    
Me:,Dunces,    
Me: ,Dunces,i do stuff like character designs  
Client:,Dunces, what does that mean  
Me: ,Dunces,i design characters and environments  like backgrounds and characters you see in animations  i design those  
Client: ,Dunces,so like what  friend  does  
Me: ,Dunces,no  he s a graphics designer  he does logos and websites and branding  i don t do that  if you want a logo  go to  friend   
Client: ,Dunces,so what do you do then  
Me: ,Dunces,i m a concept artist  i design characters and environments  basically  if you are working on an animation or video game  i can help you  
Client: ,Dunces,so explain to me what you do again  
Me:,Dunces, if you don t know what i m talking about when i say character design  then you re not the kind of client i m looking for  
Client: ,Dunces,see  people like you are the reason why your industry is small  
Client: ,Dunces,you just lost yourself a good client  
Me: ,Dunces,well  you were never my client to begin with  
Client:,Dunces, i hate gray  this gray is out of the question  
Client:,Dunces, perfect 
Client:,Dunces, thank you for the images  the app looks nice but i would like to have the actual photos of how it looks on a phone 
Client:,Dunces, no they are not  i require screenshots  not images  
Me:,Dunces, these 
.,Dunces,none
Client:,Dunces, no  they are not screenshots  my iphone has a home button and a camera on the front  i don t see those in your images  so please make some actual screenshots and send them to me 
Me:,Dunces, here are your screenshots for android and ios   taken on iphone    and samsung s  
Me,Dunces,  here s the link to the finished banner  it s a huge file so just email the printers with the link and they ll be able to download it themselves 
Client,Dunces,  the instructions are that if the file is too big to send it via wetransfer or something like that  if that is the case can you send us that file 
Me,Dunces,  the google link is just as easy to send to the printers  the pdf file is too big to attach to an email  they can access the link and download it themselves 
Client,Dunces,  we are having trouble with the upload  could you to send her the link to a wetransfer file  probably best to follow the printer s instructions  otherwise might hold everything up 
Me,Dunces,  i don t know how else to explain  what is the email address for the printers  and the message you were trying to send  i will do it 
Client: ,Dunces,i know it s my fault because i keep changing the file  but i just feel like there is something you guys could do so that every little change doesn t break the whole process 
New Business Partner:,Dunces, hi  i m looking forward to working with you  i know my way around wordpress  so we won t bug you with every little thing from now on  
Me:,Dunces, hi  it s nice to meet you 
New Business Partner:,Dunces, i m so sorry  it looks like i broke the whole website  
Client:,Dunces, what s your email  i ll just send you the file that way  
Me:,Dunces, the writable pdf with required fields functionality will not work on your website due to software limitations 
Client:,Dunces, make it work  it should work in this day and age 
Me:,Dunces, i cannot make it work  it is a software issue 
Client:,Dunces, if i remove all required fields except one will it work 
Me:,Dunces, no  
Client:,Dunces, so the answer is no 
Me:,Dunces, correct 
Client:,Dunces, ok  please replace the existing form with this pdf form 
Me:,Dunces, are you aware this new form still has required fields 
Client:,Dunces, i am aware 
Me:,Dunces, fine  i put the form you sent to me this morning on the website as you requested  it still doesn t work 
Client:,Dunces, why not 
Me: ,Dunces, in my head because the russian government has secretly hacked your website and injected code that will not make your pdf forms work the way you want  i would recommend contacting the fbi 
Me:,Dunces,   actual response    please read my prior email where i stated that the browser will not allow the specific required field functionality that you are trying to implement on the form   
Client:,Dunces, as long as i can receive it even if the required blanks are not filled out  i will be fine 
Me:,Dunces, the word  required  means that it has to be filled out  it cannot be left blank  it is     required  
Client:,Dunces,  i am testing it now on the website  why am i not receiving the email after clicking the right corner 
Me:,Dunces,  dumbfounded   i m not sure how else to explain it   it will not work the way you have it setup 
Client:,Dunces, when you said  it will not work   i assumed you meant it would ignore the required  field lines  thinking i could still receive the form even if it were not completely filled out  are you meaning that if  required fields  are within the content  it will not be sent to me 
Me:,Dunces,  is there a   year old around that i can talk to   
Client:,Dunces, we want to hire you  can we meet to discuss the project  
Me:,Dunces, great  if you want to meet i can do tuesday afternoon  wednesday morning or friday afternoon  
Client:,Dunces, ok  let s say monday afternoon  
Me:,Dunces, i m afraid i m not available on monday  would tuesday afternoon  wednesday morning or friday afternoon work  
Client:,Dunces, oh  sorry  my bad  tuesday morning then 
Me:,Dunces, sorry again  i won t be available until the afternoon on tuesday  can you tell me when you have one hour available for our meeting next week 
Client:,Dunces, let s see  i m free tuesday afternoon and wednesday morning but that won t work  too bad our calendars don t match    
Me:,Dunces,    tell you what  i ll reschedule some things so we can meet wednesday at       
Client:,Dunces, oh  great  if it s not too much trouble 
Me:,Dunces, no problem at all  
Client: ,Dunces,you made the site worse  you need to do some extra work to bring the score back up  
Me: ,Dunces,i didn t know godaddy had metrics like that  can i see the email  
Client:,Dunces,  looking at the screen  where the design doesn t literally measure  m by  m  for obvious reasons  why is the mockup so small  at this size  it will look terrible when we blow it up to print 
Me:,Dunces, haha  no  it s just because you re seeing it at about     of the actual size  so it fits on the screen and you can actually see the entire design  but it s at a     ratio  it s designed exactly to fit a  m by  m panel  
Client:,Dunces,  pointing at the photoshop ruler at the top of the screen that ends at    cm  but this says it s only    cm  
Me:,Dunces, yes     cm is the same as  m 
Client:,Dunces, no  it s not 
Me:,Dunces,    
Client:,Dunces,  owns a kajillion dollar high tech state of the art company 
Also Client: ,Dunces, opens the backup pdf in powerpoint instead of the powerpoint file i sent them 
Me:,Dunces, i would like a quote for     business cards printed in black and white on two sides 
Printer:,Dunces, sure  just let me know how many cards you d like  if they d be printed in color or only in black  and if you need two sided printing 
Me:,Dunces, uh    
Client:,Dunces, why is the file smaller than the last version 
Me:,Dunces, it s just a different way to compile the file  there shouldn t be any difference when you open it  
Me: ,Dunces, thinking  you only need this file for a meeting  the video is going to shown on a regular size projector  are you worried the file won t work on imax or something  
Client:,Dunces, the illustrations on this file look blurry 
Me: ,Dunces, internally  well yeah if you re zoomed in      your   inch file s gonna look a little blurry karen 
Client: ,Dunces,wait  this is it  this is the logo  
Me: ,Dunces,yeah  i will send it to you in a variety of formats including a  vector  version that can be printed at any size without issues  you can use this on any of your materials 
Client: ,Dunces,so it s just a picture  i m paying for just a picture 
Me: ,Dunces,uh    
Me:,Dunces, can you please send me your company logo as an  ai file 
Me: ,Dunces,     
Client: ,Dunces,i ve just made a few updates 
Me: ,Dunces,sorry  but 
Client: ,Dunces,oh  you just don t understand me 
Client:,Dunces,  why did you 
Me:,Dunces,  as general rule  it s best to avoid exclamation points in formal writing   the strength of a sentence should rest on emphatic prose rather than emphatic punctuation 
Client:,Dunces,  but no one will know where the important points are   
Me:,Dunces,  i think they will if the points are made with clear  vigorous writing and simple periods 
Client:,Dunces, but that s what exclamation points are for        can we change those sentences to 
Client,Dunces,   sent monday     pm  can you please update this page according to the attached document 
Client,Dunces,   sent tuesday     am  i know i just gave it to you  but is there any way you could get that up today  i was a little behind getting it to you 
Client,Dunces,   sent wednesday     am  how is that page going       
Client,Dunces,   sent wednesday     am  omg you are going to be mad at me  i m so sorry   we 
Client,Dunces,  could you put it one pixel to the right 
Client: ,Dunces,perfect 
Client,Dunces,  i don t understand this       hours meeting time thing
Me,Dunces,  oh  that just means  pm in 
Client,Dunces,  but we ll be in spain and they re an hour ahead of the uk so it s really  pm
Me:,Dunces, no   pm is  pm wherever you are
Client,Dunces,  you re not listening to me        is  pm in the uk so it s  pm in spain
Me: ,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces,  via mail  
Client:,Dunces, they look perfect  thank you 
Client: ,Dunces,if the user encounters a risk on the course  could you make the computer vibrate 
Client:,Dunces, my daughter has taken a college english course and she says that every instance of  that  needs to be  which  and the opposite in all instances in the book 
Me:,Dunces, actually  they re all correct as is  honoring the standard  that  for restrictive and  which  for non restrictive   for example  it would properly be   the dog that my aunt had  which was a mixed breed  was named whoknows   if one were to follow your directive above  it would incorrectly read   the dog which my aunt had  that was a mixed breed  was named whoknows    
Client:,Dunces, she 
Me: ,Dunces,with all due respect  i majored in it  plus i have    years of editing experience  
Client:,Dunces, i m sure the rule has changed since you were in college   maybe you should take a refresher to catch up on current rules 
Client: ,Dunces,hi  i know we haven t talked in over a year but i was wondering if you would like to do some freelancing for us  we are going to stop working with  ecommerce agency  due to  my old boss  programmatically ordering food through the ecommerce system without paying  he is saying that he was just testing the order flow and forgot to cancel them  however  it has happened about    times now 
Me:,Dunces, here is the first draft  i used placeholder text it s called  lorem ipsum  to fill the empty spaces since i m still waiting on copy from you 
Client:,Dunces, oh  i see it  you know 
Client:,Dunces, we really like what you have  but we re worried that you left a few of the details out 
Me:,Dunces, well  with only    seconds to work with it would be very difficult to include everything  i can rework the scripts to include more information  but if the spot is nothing but information it will likely sound very stale and uninteresting 
Client:,Dunces, that s fine  just see what you can do 
Client:,Dunces, i see what you re trying to do with these scripts  but 
Client:,Dunces, oh  these are perfect  see  i knew you could do it  
Me:,Dunces, now  since you have a longer email address  and many of your customers are 
Client:,Dunces, what   no  i don t spell mine that way  if you capitalize those letters  it won t get to me  i ve never changed how i typed it and i m not going to start now 
Me:,Dunces, err   okay  ma am  but i really do think you could benefit from the change  i promise that you ll still receive your emails just fine 
Client: ,Dunces,no  i m paying you to design what 
I,Dunces, want  so why don t you just leave things alone  
Client:,Dunces, hey   my name   i had a 
brilliant,Dunces, idea  see  what we re going to do is capitalize the first letter in each word in my email address and redo the whole stationery set  that way it s easier for my customers to read  i am just so clever 
Client:,Dunces, 
Me:,Dunces, as we told you two months ago  we have moved servers and you need to change your domain s name servers 
Client:,Dunces, i already did that  i double checked this morning 
Me:,Dunces, i m looking at the whois records and it s saying you haven t  if you just give me your username and password for your registrar  we can go in and change it for you 
Client:,Dunces, but i don t have the login information 
Me:,Dunces, then how d you double check your name servers are correct 
Client:,Dunces, are you questioning my authority  i m the customer  i m 
Client:,Dunces, everything looks great  but when you have a moment  can you 
Me:,Dunces, sure  
Me:,Dunces, how s that 
Client:,Dunces, it still looks a little light  can you darken it more 
Me:,Dunces, no problem 
Me:,Dunces, is that better 
Client:,Dunces, that s still too light  try darkening just a little more 
Me:,Dunces, sorry about that 
Me:,Dunces, try it now 
Client:,Dunces, perfect  i have an eye for these things  you know 
Me:,Dunces, just to remind you that  as we discussed  i m sending 
Client:,Dunces, what you really mean is that you need spending money for your holiday 
Me:,Dunces, no  not at all  i m just getting everything sorted before i leave  the invoice isn t due until a couple of days after i get back 
Client:,Dunces, it s okay  you don t need to get defensive  i ll pay your invoice this afternoon  as long as you tell your kids that uncle client is the one paying for their ice creams 
Me:,Dunces, i think i ll tell them that mummy is paying for their ice creams by providing a copywriting service that people pay for 
Client:,Dunces, ha  yes  you tell them that if it makes you feel better 
Boss:,Dunces, i just read the copy you sent through 
Freelancer:,Dunces, oh yeah  
Boss:,Dunces, it is quite possibly the worst written piece of crap i have ever read  nothing makes any sense and it feels like it has been written by a   year old 
Freelancer:,Dunces, but 
Boss:,Dunces, i don t know how you can call yourself a  copywriter  if you can t even spell  most of these words don t mean anything relevant to this project and i feel that i have wasted my time hiring you for a job you quite clearly can t do  once again i have to do these things myself 
Freelancer:,Dunces, the document i sent has not been changed from the original you sent me  i only added a couple of questions in red at the end that needed answering before i could proceed 
Client:,Dunces, what are they for 
Client:,Dunces, really  hm  they look expensive  how much were they 
Client:,Dunces, what  you re kidding  seriously  have you paid him yet  i ve got a 
Client:,Dunces, we don t like the music at all 
Me:,Dunces, what don t you like about it 
Client:,Dunces, it needs more  pep  and needs to be more  upbeat   this is just not doing it 
Me:,Dunces, i have several other choices we can listen to so i can get a better idea of what you mean 
Client:,Dunces, yeah  that one  why didn t you use that one 
Me:,Dunces, as you can see   your competitor  
Client:,Dunces, well try  own company name  
Me:,Dunces, yes  you rank first for that  however  that shouldn t be your main focus  since 
Me: ,Dunces,does everything look good for you 
Client:,Dunces, everything is great  but who is this girl in front of the background 
Me:,Dunces, um  that s the character you wanted me to design 
Client:,Dunces, what  i didn t ask for that  i said to give the chair more character 
Client:,Dunces, don t you try  
Client:,Dunces, you mean to tell me that you haven t been working on my campaign at all over the last eight weeks  all this time you ve been sitting there doing nothing   
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry  there must have been a big miscommunication  we never signed a contract and you made it clear you didn t have a budget to hire me  so no  i have not been working on your project for the last two months  but we can fix this  let s meet tonight and get this campaign started 
Client:,Dunces, why bother  don t you know the first few months of business are the most important time for marketing   i thought you understood  this is a disaster  i can t believe you did this to me 
Client:,Dunces, why would you assume i wanted the columns to be vertical 
Me:,Dunces, i   i m sorry  how did you want them 
Client:,Dunces, obviously  i wanted horizontal columns 
Me:,Dunces, like rows 
Client:,Dunces, exactly like rows 
Me:,Dunces, your order is ready for pickup  i ve tried to call multiple times over the past few days  but your voicemail box was full and i couldn t leave a message 
Client:,Dunces, so my order has been ready  why didn t you let me know  
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry  but when i called the number you provided  i couldn t leave a message for you 
Client:,Dunces, thanks a lot  the closing was yesterday  now i ll have to give it to them after the fact 
Me:,Dunces, again  i tried calling multiple times  to no answer and a full machine  
Client:,Dunces, well of course i didn t answer  i assumed someone calling that much was trying to spam me  
Client: ,Dunces,yeah  so great he had to come back to do it again 
Client:,Dunces, these posters look terrible   it s missing the date and some of the colors 
Me:,Dunces, i m looking at the final example here   the one we agreed on   and it looks like i didn t forget anything  but maybe  
Client:,Dunces, you know we have 
Me:,Dunces, yes  of course i know that   but i don t know what went wrong  if you could send  
Client:,Dunces, it s not my job to know what s wrong  it is yours 
Me:,Dunces, if you can just send me the pdf you used for a quick look  then  
Client:,Dunces, what are you going do about this 
Me:,Dunces, i have had them make you some new posters  free of charge  because the rush the method is a little different  so the quality won t be the same  but  
Client:,Dunces, jesus f    ing christ  how in the world can you be so unprofessional  dumbass 
Me:,Dunces, as i ve told you  the problem lies with the printer you use  apparently  
Client:,Dunces, hi  can you make me a cd  i want to know what it costs and when it ll be done 
Me:,Dunces, sure  what kind of package do you want  what can you tell me about the artist and their music 
Client:,Dunces, no time for any of that bs  just tell me the prices 
Me:,Dunces, well  here are some rough ballparks for five or six different package types 
Client:,Dunces, just make me a few of each 
Me:,Dunces, can we narrow it down a little  and can you at least tell me the artist name and type of music they make 
Client:,Dunces, 
Me:,Dunces, sorry  no offense  but i think i m going to pass on this project 
Client:,Dunces, motherf   er  do you think whitney houston gave up when people told her to  do you think michael jackson quit when the work was hard  man up  you p   y 
Client:,Dunces, i need you to recommend some of your design students to help me build a naked news style website with an emphasis on financial markets 
Me:,Dunces, sir  we are a 
Client:,Dunces, why not  adam and eve were naked  weren t they 
Client:,Dunces, how could you write this script without a storyboard  
Me:,Dunces, the storyboard comes after you write the script  it s where you develop a rough guide for the visuals that are going to accompany the narration  it shows how the visuals will flow in the video  
Client:,Dunces, no  the storyboard is the document where you describe the approach you re going to take and outline the topics to cover   
Me:,Dunces, that s the specifications document   
Client:,Dunces, well  i call that the storyboard  and you didn t write one   
Client:,Dunces, we gave you everything you needed  everything you asked for you  and you did nothing with it  we re just wasting money on you  
Me:,Dunces, look  you can 
Client:,Dunces, oh yeah  name one thing you needed that we didn t deliver  one thing 
Me:,Dunces, in an email we sent on the   th of last month  titled  
Client:,Dunces, you can t even take responsibility for your failings  
Client:,Dunces, listen  we need a brochure 
Me:,Dunces, i sent you a more or less finished layout almost a year ago  you said you ll just look over it and let me know if you d want any changes done 
Client:,Dunces, oh  oh right  send it to me again and i ll have a look 
Client:,Dunces, this looks great  why didn t you send me these earlier 
Me:,Dunces, i did  last june 
Client:,Dunces,  well  you know i m a very busy man 
Me:,Dunces, yes  yes  i know  while we re at it  have you had a chance to look at those spray can layouts i did a couple of weeks ago 
Client:,Dunces, uh  yes  it looks great  send them off to the printer asap 
Me:,Dunces, which one  i made four of them 
Client:,Dunces, oh  uh  well  if i had it my way  i d just have white blank ones and write the company name on with a marker  so like   i really don t care 
Client:,Dunces, this looks like shit  i can t believe you sent these things away without my approval first  that s extremely unprofessional  you know that 
Client:,Dunces,  webdesign  fail    myhandle  s contact form terribly broken  can t get in touch about my project won t be using her services   inept 
Me: ,Dunces,  client  thx for yr honest feedback  sorry to hear you had difficulty w my form  i d like to diagnose the issue pls contact me    myemail  
Client:,Dunces,  via email  what kind of web designer are you  i tried to upload my project s documents  only   mb of pdfs  using your contact form and it didn t work  
Me:,Dunces, yes  my contact form isn t designed to allow uploads of any kind  it s just a simple way for folks to state the nature of their project and start a conversation  i m so sorry that misunderstanding was frustrating experience for you  now that we re communicating via email  i d be more than happy to take a look at your documents and learn more about your project 
Client:,Dunces, 
Me:,Dunces, attached is a pdf of the final draft of your flyer  please look it over one last time  if everything is as it should be  please give me final approval to print 
Client:,Dunces, everything is right  but can i have an html  
Me:,Dunces, i m not sure what you mean  this is a print flyer  why do you need code  
Client:,Dunces, what don t you understand  i want an html  i thought you were a designer 
Me:,Dunces, i think you may be asking for the wrong thing  can you explain what you plan to use the flyer for  can you put me in touch with your marketing or web department 
Client:,Dunces, i m most certainly not asking for the wrong thing  i know i need an html  i want to put a picture in my email  it should only take you one minute to make an html  why don t you know how to do this 
Me:,Dunces, i think what you re looking for is an image file of the flyer  i took some screenshots of the pdf for you  in  jpeg format 
Client:,Dunces, finally  was that so hard  also  you messed up the phone number  so please fix the flyer  now you can print     
Client:,Dunces, can you combine these three elements graphically so they all fit on one page and make sense 
Me:,Dunces, sure  but it s going to need to be a pretty big page to be readable  like    x    
Client:,Dunces, ok  sounds fine  just make it work 
Client:,Dunces, oh  this sheet is way too big  if we shrink it down to letter size  do you think it s going to be too small to read 
Me:,Dunces, yeah  that s why i said it would need to be this size 
Client:,Dunces, how about we separate it into six sections and put each section on    x    paper 
Me:,Dunces, that can work  if you re sure that s what you want 
Client:,Dunces, you know  i d like to think we have a good enough working relationship that you d tell me if something i asked for was not going to work and 
Me:,Dunces, well  i did 
Client:,Dunces, yeah  but i m the one who came up with the idea of splitting it into sections  next time  i d like you to be the one making those suggestions 
Me:,Dunces, so you asked me to put it all on one page but that s not really what you wanted  but you wanted me to know that before you knew it 
Client:,Dunces, well  yes 
Client:,Dunces, the title on that report is off centre by      th of an inch 
Me:,Dunces, you re kidding  right 
Client:,Dunces, no  
Client:,Dunces, can we make the app icon the same size and color as snapchat 
Client:,Dunces, can you recreate the settings gear from snapchat 
Client:,Dunces, make the login buttons the same size and color as in snapchat 
Client:,Dunces, the outlines of the logo need to be the same thickness and color as the snapchat logo 
Client:,Dunces, i need the specs for this unit and they are too damn small on your website 
Me:,Dunces, sir  you re just looking at the thumbnail  click it to open 
Client:,Dunces, click the what 
Me:,Dunces, the thumbnail  the small picture of the specs 
Client:,Dunces, what the f     
Client:,Dunces, marie  pick up the damn phone 
Client:,Dunces, marie  what the hell is a thumbnail 
Marie:,Dunces, the thing on the end of my thumb 
Me:,Dunces, sir  it just a term for a small picture  if it s not clear  i m the webmaster and i can change the page so that it is  
Client:,Dunces, no  i m sick of you canadians making up your own damn language  when someone is ready to speak english to me you can call me back at  unintelligible phone number  or you can f    off 
Client:,Dunces, sorry to keep you waiting 
Me:,Dunces, that s okay  
Client:,Dunces, what  you re on the clock  i was only on the phone catching up with my sister  if i d known i was paying you to stand there i would have got off 
Client:,Dunces, i need these drawings printed at   x   
Me:,Dunces, ok  but if i do that  it won t be to scale 
Client:,Dunces, do i need it to 
Me:,Dunces, are you going to use it to build something 
Client:,Dunces, of course  they re blueprints 
Me:,Dunces, then yes  you do need it to scale 
Me:,Dunces, keep your users in mind 
Client:,Dunces, but we don t want to make pages for users  we want to make pages for google 
Client:,Dunces, i need 
Me:,Dunces, they should be listed as   through   above the qwertyuiop row of keys  you probably have a number pad on the right side of your keyboard too 
Client:,Dunces, no  not those numbers  i m not a complete idiot  like five and nine  but the ones that look like i s  v  s and x s 
Me:,Dunces, you mean roman numerals  keyboards don t have those 
Client:,Dunces, then how do i type them 
Me:,Dunces, i  v  and x  if you want five  then write v  for nine  write ix  et cetera 
Client:,Dunces, but those are just letters 
Client:,Dunces, this html email template you did doesn t work 
Me:,Dunces, but you approved it three months ago 
Client:,Dunces, yes  but one of my staff changed it  and now it doesn t work 
Me:,Dunces, so they broke it 
Client:,Dunces, no  what you supplied didn t work 
Me:,Dunces, then why did you approve it 
Client:,Dunces, it did work  but now it doesn t  please fix it now 
Me:,Dunces, you want me to fix the mistakes your staff made 
Client:,Dunces, they didn t do anything 
Me:,Dunces, you just said  
Client:,Dunces, i need you to 
Me:,Dunces, i m still waiting on the     deposit we discussed  if we don t get it in the next couple of days  we ll miss the deadline  it s already tight as it is 
Client:,Dunces, we re still trying to decide which investor we like best 
Me:,Dunces, at this point just pick one  or you won t have anything to invest in for another year 
Client:,Dunces, well  we re also working on a commercial  is it alright if we take it out of your deposit 
Me:,Dunces, no  that is not alright  we re working on the software  not the commercial 
Client:,Dunces, why can t you do the commercial too 
Me:,Dunces, we re a programming firm  not a marketing firm 
Client:,Dunces, oh  well how much have you done so far  we d really like to put some of it in the commercial 
Me:,Dunces, as we ve discussed  we can t start working on your project until you pay the deposit 
Client:,Dunces, but we haven t decided on an investor yet 
Client:,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces, oh  i have a call on my cell  let me put you on hold a minute 
Me:,Dunces, that s really okay  you can 
Client:,Dunces, no  i will put you on hold 
Client:,Dunces,  sighing loudly  i m going to have to let you go now  yeah  this stupid girl from that web service company is on the other line  i have to help her finish figuring out how to do her job 
Me:,Dunces, here s the high res version of the logo  let me know when i can expect to have my invoice returned 
Client:,Dunces, um  about that   i m not sure i can approve this 
Me:,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces, that was yesterday 
Me:,Dunces, yeah  
Client:,Dunces, it s not yesterday anymore  
Client:,Dunces, i want google adwords  but i want you to pick random keywords that are cheap because nobody ever uses them  maybe we could even make up new words and set them as our keywords  be creative  it s your job 
Me:,Dunces, well  that s not exactly how adwords works  let me explain why it s good to pick keywords that match with your content  
Client:,Dunces, bullshit  you just want me to be 
Me:,Dunces, it won t change again  right 
Client:,Dunces, of course not  but can we try a different color 
Client:,Dunces, no thank you  you are not building the websites  i can tell from the spanish text you re using a template  all my templates have that too  why should i pay for it  
Client:,Dunces, i see where you are going  and based on the premise  we will not score very well   
Client:,Dunces, the tray back file is not exact  send me      cm x      cm like the front cover so it can go in the back of the jewel case 
Me:,Dunces, but the tray is not square  it s       mm x     mm with bleed
Client:,Dunces, you re the designer  i m the client  the customer knows best  please send me the design 
Client:,Dunces, 
-1,Dunces, it s really nice  looks great 
Client: (2),Dunces, umm  yeah   gives a little smirk   i ve done music long enough  but even an untrained eye would pick up on this  it s pretty obvious that the guy is overdubbed and what he is playing is not the 
Me:,Dunces, actually  no audio work has been done yet  what you were hearing was the mic in the room and that is actually him playing
Client: (2) ,Dunces, yeah  like i said

Client:,Dunces, it s  x y z k j i o w t dot 
Me:,Dunces, wait  by  dot   do you mean period  the period is part of the password and not a period ending a sentence 
Client:,Dunces, yes  why would a period end a sentence 
Client:,Dunces, can you revise the copy on the first frame  here  use this  it tells our product story and conveys our brand promise most 
Me:,Dunces, sure  we ll send the revised frames this evening 
Client: ,Dunces,i don t like the copy  seems vague  can t you do better 
Client:,Dunces, there s a strange symbol after the company name   can you remove it 
Me:,Dunces, hmm  i don t see anything  does it come after the exclamation point 
Client:,Dunces, the what 
Me:,Dunces, the line and dot after   wait  you mean 
Client:,Dunces, i guess  is that what that s called 
Client:,Dunces, hey  if we have a bunch of people s email addresses can we just  like  mass email them from outlook 
Me:,Dunces, yes  that s possible 
Client:,Dunces, is there a term for that 
Me:,Dunces, 
Client: ,Dunces,everything needs to be done in 
Me: ,Dunces,is this better 
Client:,Dunces, perfect  great team effort 
Client:,Dunces, why is this taking so long  don t you know anything about infomatics

Me:,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces, do i really have to sit here and make sure you remind me about what i am supposed to do 
Client:,Dunces, why did you cancel my invoice 
Me:,Dunces, all unpaid invoices are cancelled after    hours  you delayed payment without explanation by two weeks last time  and this is the fourth time this has happened in a row 
Client:,Dunces, you didn t give me    hours last time 
Me:,Dunces, no  we gave you two weeks  or     hours 
Client:,Dunces, my mistake  i thought it said days  anyway  why did you cancel this invoice  i didn t get an invoice from you  and it s wrong anyway 
Me:,Dunces, you didn t get an invoice 
Client:,Dunces, no 
Me:,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces, i think so  can you check it  i didn t get it 
Me:,Dunces, no  it s been cancelled  you can reorder and can pay now  if you like  we have your order on file 
Client:,Dunces, i don t get why you cancelled it  you said you allow    hours for payment  i didn t get an invoice 
Me:,Dunces, we do  yes  it had been three days 
Client:,Dunces, well yeah  the original invoice i got on friday at         it s date stamped in my email  i can show you if you think i m lying   but the reminder you sent me was only    hours ago 
Me:,Dunces, you re looking at the invoice you said you didn t get 
Client:,Dunces, that s right and it s date stamped for friday at       
Client:,Dunces, i ve had them for six months  you just haven t asked for them 
Me:,Dunces, i asked before you made the photos and after you said you had them 
Client:,Dunces, oh  i haven t read my personal email in five months 
Client:,Dunces, i want to make a social networking website which i can earn profits from 
Me:,Dunces, can you provide me with more details

Client:,Dunces, hey  do you think you could 
Me:,Dunces, if you email me the information  i can let you know   
Client: ,Dunces,you blew me off by asking me to email you the information  and you were rude enough not to follow up  
Client:,Dunces, 
Client: ,Dunces,what do you mean you re not on the train  what s the problem with your ticket  i used that code this morning and it worked fine for me  and anyway  if you d really wanted to have got on that train you could have made it happen 
Client: ,Dunces,well  what have you got for me 
Me:,Dunces, so  suppose we do a match between the customer database and the transactions database and 
Client:,Dunces, you are so na ve 
Me:,Dunces, what did i do  i barely started 
Client:,Dunces, you see that database  it s mine  the other one belongs to the sob in the next room  and 
Me:,Dunces, hello  you re speaking to  
Client:,Dunces,  drunk and angry  f    off and listen  
Me:,Dunces, and this is a  bank a  card  correct 
Client:,Dunces, of course it is  why else would i ring you 
Me:,Dunces, alright sir  but first  
Client:,Dunces,  swears under breathe 
Me: ,Dunces,i need your customer id number 
Client:,Dunces, what the f    is that 
Me:,Dunces, the    digit number used for telephone and online banking 
Client:,Dunces, how the f    am i supposed to now that 
Me:,Dunces,  bank a  gives this number to you when you join us  it starts with your birthday and ends with four other numbers you should know 
Client:,Dunces,  shouting  well i don t f   ing know it  so just fix my card 
Me:,Dunces, unfortunately  you will have to call back tomorrow and speak to the fraud team so they can id you 
Client:,Dunces, what the f   ing f    do you mean  call tomorrow   i need it fixed now  if you don t  i ll sue you  not the bank  you  for not allowing me to just access my account without any hassle  do you know who i am  i have millions of pounds in your bank and i will ruin you 
Me:,Dunces, sir  threatening me will accomplish nothing   bank a  has specific guidelines to protect you  your account  and those  millions   remember  he s bankrupt  of pounds 
Client:,Dunces, did you say  bank a  
Me:,Dunces, yes  my name is so and so and i work for  bank a  
Client:,Dunces, nevermind  this is a  bank b  card  
Me:,Dunces,it looks like the auto recover feature was turned off 
Client: ,Dunces,that doesn t sound like 
Me:,Dunces, i m looking at your preferences right here    save auto recover info  is unchecked 
Client: ,Dunces,yeah  i m pretty sure i wouldn t do anything like that  so there must be auto recover files somewhere  keep looking 
Client:,Dunces, here s the final copy  
Me:,Dunces, are you sure this is the copy you want to run with 
Client:,Dunces, 
Me:,Dunces, if you say so  but just so you know  the copy says  keep your equipment ruining in top shape  
Client:,Dunces, we both know it is supposed to read  running in top shape   why would you use the copy if there s a mistake 
Me:,Dunces, well  final usually means final 
Client:,Dunces, well  final has a new meaning  
Client:,Dunces, i ve been lurking your work for months now and it s beautiful  i have finally decided you are the person i d like to do my wedding makeup  
Me:,Dunces, thank you so much for the compliment  but unfortunately  i m already booked on that date  my apologies 
Client:,Dunces, but i ve been lurking your work for months  
Me:,Dunces, yes  but you can t book a date that way  i need clients to make a formal booking to secure my time 
Client:,Dunces, can t you just cancel the other booking 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry  no  i couldn t do that to a customer who has secured my time and paid my booking fee well in advance 
Client:,Dunces, your customer service is appalling 
Client: ,Dunces,email is the best way to reach me and ensure that i get your message 
Client: ,Dunces, via email  i get too many emails  so just call me here at the office 
Client: ,Dunces, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post             email reply from client after sending an updated  where are my proofs   a 
Me: ,Dunces,i called numerous times  but your receptionist wouldn t let e speak to you 
Client: ,Dunces,yeah  i told her to screen my calls  just call me on my mobile 
Client: ,Dunces,i just ignore my phone s voicemail  call my office or email me 
Client: ,Dunces,why are you sending me a letter  it s      for god s sake  there are better ways to get a hold of me  
Client:,Dunces, you do your work on a computer  right 
Me:,Dunces, yes  sir 
Client:,Dunces, so you 
Client:,Dunces, i want a simple font for my homepage 
Me:,Dunces, something like verdana 
Client:,Dunces, oh no  i hate that verdana style  look   maybe like on this page 
Me:,Dunces, the body text 
Client:,Dunces, yeah 
Me:,Dunces, that s verdana 
Client:,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces, i m not happy  i need to see more creative ideas from you  looking back at this year  you re just doing the basics  our marketing should be more professional and better coordinated 
Me:,Dunces, i programmed a year long strategic program for you  you declined virtually all of it  
Client:,Dunces, what happened in the past is not relevant here 
Client:,Dunces, 
Me:,Dunces, when did you send it 
Client:,Dunces, just now 
Me:,Dunces, it must still be sending 
Client:,Dunces, i ll hold till you get it 
Me:,Dunces, there it is 
Client:,Dunces, so  
Me:,Dunces, is there anything else 
Client:,Dunces, well  did you read it yet 
Me:,Dunces, it s quite the wall of text   i ll get back to you as soon as i m able 
Client:,Dunces, i ll wait  
Me:,Dunces, i m just checking in on your feedback for the draft of the ad i sent you 
Client: ,Dunces, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post            client we see that youve listed project  it was perfect  a 
Me:,Dunces, but there were unpurchased stock photos in it with watermarks spread across them  plus it was a very low resolution file which won t look good printed 
Client:,Dunces, well  next time you need to be more clear and let me know that it was just a draft 
Me:,Dunces, i explained quite clearly in the email 
Client:,Dunces, oh  i skipped over all that and just looked at the attachment  put it in the subject next time 
Me:,Dunces, the subject was  draft attached   it was the first word 
Client: ,Dunces,i told you i wanted the words in parentheses  if you re too busy to get that fucking right  
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry  but i m looking at the art right now  as you requested  there are parentheses around the phrase 
Client:,Dunces, no  there are fucking brackets  you fucking idiot  where did you go to school  i want parentheses  they re the two little lines in the air at the top of each end  
Me:,Dunces, ma am  you have spyware on your computer 
Client:,Dunces, yeah  i have spyware on purpose 
Client:,Dunces, 
Me: ,Dunces,awesome  what you need 
Client:,Dunces, i can t tell you  just make half of the site area a rectangular blank space  i ll fill it later 
Me:,Dunces, i strongly suggest we work together on this 
Client:,Dunces, if i tell you  you will steal my idea 
Me:,Dunces, but what do you want me to do then 
Client:,Dunces, it s very simple  i need you to teach me your work  when i m done  i ll publish it myself 
Me:,Dunces, that s not going to happen 
Client:,Dunces, ok  i ll tell you  but i need complete silence about it until it s done  okay 
Me:,Dunces, sure 
Client:,Dunces, it s very simple  i need my clients to able to see how they are going to be on the dresses i make  online 
Me:,Dunces, well  i m afraid it has be done before  but that just means it s easier for us  i can do a sketch model appear online so that the client can imagine themselves in your dresses 
Client:,Dunces, no  i want them to literally see themselves 
Me:,Dunces, a user can upload a headshot  but it probably won t look that great in the end 
Client:,Dunces, no no no  i told you  it s very simple  you just have to program part of the monitor to be a mirror 
Client:,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces, and his hair is too long 
Client: ,Dunces,i registered blaketheelevatorgriffin com  i need to sell this thing and make some money 
Me:,Dunces, have you heard from anyone expressing interest in making a purchase 
Client:,Dunces, nah  but 
Client:,Dunces, should i send the logo 
Me:,Dunces, send it wtf 
Client:,Dunces, what s that 
Me:,Dunces, i m joking with you  send it as a png 
Client:,Dunces, nice try  but i m not that stupid  
Client:,Dunces, what the hell happened to the flyer 
Me:,Dunces, erm  you saw the proof and you told me liked it 
Client:,Dunces, yeah  i liked that one  but this new one is horrible 
Me:,Dunces, what new one 
Client:,Dunces, the one that  the company  sent over this morning 
Me:,Dunces, what happened to the design i sent over  the client was happy with the design  why did you change it 
Company Boss:,Dunces, well  
Client: ,Dunces,this looks pretty good  but you need to change the font to the official university font 
Me: ,Dunces,i thought the university font was futura  that s what i used 
Client: ,Dunces,no  i don t remember what it was called but if you check the hard drive  there should be 
Client: ,Dunces,oh  yes  that s much better 
Client:,Dunces,  secretary  has had to go on home early thanks to you  what s your problem 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry what 
Client:,Dunces, i see you 
Me:,Dunces, i m pretty much ready to start the design of the presentation   i m just missing the text for each slide  when can i expect it 
Client:,Dunces, actually we didn t have time to write anything down  so if you can just come up with something  it would be great 
Client:,Dunces, the presentation is great  but the text is all wrong  in the future  take the time to 
Client:,Dunces, i need to get some postcards designed promoting a new luxury brand we a representing  but it will be a tight turnaround 
Me:,Dunces, sure thing  send me the assets  i ll get started today 
Client:,Dunces, we don t have anything yet  it s not been finalized   but just use this image attached 
Me:,Dunces, that s a thumbnail image  it s only  cm wide at    dpi  we can t print that 
Client:,Dunces, don t you have 
Me:,Dunces, no  sorry  it s just far too small i don t think this is a good idea for a luxury brand 
Client:,Dunces, it s all we have  just use it
Me:,Dunces, ok  but it s not going to look any good  here s a proof  if you print it out  you ll see what i mean 
Client:,Dunces, it looks fine to me 
Me:,Dunces, did you print it 
Client:,Dunces, yes  i looked at it in acrobat  please send me the print file  this needs to go to print tonight 
Client:,Dunces, i m really unhappy with the postcards  the quality was substandard  and it reflects badly on us and on you 
Client:,Dunces, did you make sure that video ends with the english title card 
Me:,Dunces, yes  i reviewed it already   it ends with the english title card 
Client:,Dunces, are you sure 
Me:,Dunces, yes
Client:,Dunces, play it 
Client: ,Dunces,is it in english 
Me:,Dunces,  yes 
Client:,Dunces, 
Me:,Dunces, i am absolutely positive 
Client:,Dunces,  okay  i just wanted to make sure it wasn t in russian 
Me:,Dunces, i see you mentioned you have 
Client:,Dunces, the winning designer must be very well versed in magneto or other top brand e commerce programs  we will be wanting payments online and magneto or comparable program is the most important item 
Me:,Dunces,  stifling a laugh  personally  i ve always preferred professor x  they re equally matched  in my opinion 
Client:,Dunces, oh  uh  okay  sounds good  i ve heard great things about professor x 
Client:,Dunces, i need to speak to howard  it s urgent 
Me:,Dunces, i m sorry  howard doesn t work friday afternoons  can i

Me:,Dunces, yes  the printer has also contacted me  i let him know that i am waiting on additional content from you and when i get that  i could get a better timeframe  hopefully by next week   i am just waiting on the pictures 
Client:,Dunces, have you made the text changes yet  we really need to get this to the printer 
Me:,Dunces, yes  the text changes have been made  i am still waiting on the additional pics that you wanted to add before it goes to the printer 
Client:,Dunces, there is also another addition we wanted to make to the culture section  you should know this by now 
Me:,Dunces, yes  i do know  but i can t add it if i don t have the copy to add  please send the pictures and the additional copy so i can add it 
Client:,Dunces, look  if you can t get this done  why don t you just say so 
Me: ,Dunces,i can  but i need those materials from you first 
Client: ,Dunces,and when will you be getting those 
Me: ,Dunces, 
Me: ,Dunces,your username is your first name  
Client:,Dunces, it doesn t work 
Me: ,Dunces,strange  it should be xxxxx   
Client:,Dunces, nope  doesn t work 
Me: ,Dunces,looks like you didn t add the exclamation mark when typing the password 
Client:,Dunces, oh  i didn t think that was part of the password 
Me: ,Dunces,well  i wasn t shouting it 
Client:,Dunces, can you do that in simyak 
Me:,Dunces, what

Client: ,Dunces,what s your phone number  and what do you do again 
Client: ,Dunces, in an email with the subject line  xxxxx week        why the hell aren t we getting any impressions on our counter  i can t even see the ad 
Me:,Dunces, because the ad campaign starts next week 
Client: ,Dunces, a href  http   clientsfromhell net post             me the internet isnt working but dont worry  how unprofessional on your part   a 
Me:,Dunces, what s the name on the card 
Client: ,Dunces,mastercard gold 
Client:,Dunces, you re shooting your commercial in two days  we got you a model for the shoot 
Me:,Dunces, two days  the boards aren t even made 
Client:,Dunces, you make them   
Me:,Dunces, okay  can she play the piano  half the commercial is her playing the piano 
Client:,Dunces, no  she s a model 
Me:,Dunces, but is she a model who can play the piano 
Client:,Dunces, no 
Me:,Dunces, you re saying that our commercial which involves a girl playing a piano has a girl who can t play the piano 
Client:,Dunces, you can fake it to music in post 
Me:,Dunces, what music  i haven t had time to pick any music 
Client:,Dunces, i ll pick the music after the shoot 
Me:,Dunces, we need to know what music we re using if she s going to mimic it 
Client:,Dunces, no it ll be fine  she doesn t  you said you needed a piano right 
Me:,Dunces, for the piano playing  yes  it s all on the list  hr has a copy 
Client:,Dunces, okay  i ll book it  anything else i need to book  i got you two cars 
Me:,Dunces, what about the car mount 
Client:,Dunces, wait  do you want the car mount or the cars  make up your mind 
Me:,Dunces, why would i want a car mount without a car  both  i still need to approve the girl  the wardrobe  props  etc 
Client:,Dunces, i ll do it  you don t need to know about it  i ll see what i can change on the list 
Me:,Dunces, when are we shooting this 
Client:,Dunces, friday  shut up for a second 
Me:,Dunces, so you re saying that nothing is ready for the shoot that s in less than    hours 
Client:,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces, it s beautiful  i love everything about it  just perfect  could you just insert our old newsletter content and send it back so we can see how it looks 
Me:,Dunces, of course 
Client:,Dunces, ugh  what s wrong with this new template 
Me:,Dunces, what do you mean 
Client:,Dunces, the copy is so long  and the photos are ugly  i hate it  
Me:,Dunces, that s what you had on the old newsletter  it s long because the copy was long  and i just used the same photos you used before 
Client:,Dunces, when you sent the draft it looked great  but now that it has our photos and copy  it looks awful  i don t get how you messed this up 
Me:,Dunces, the copy and photos you asked me to use should probably be replaced 
Client:,Dunces, you obviously 
Client:,Dunces, i want you to design me a website 
Me:,Dunces, is it for your existing business 
Client:,Dunces, no 
Me:,Dunces, what is the website for 
Client:,Dunces, it can be anything  i just want you to design me a  com website that i can sell it later for a lot of money 
Client:,Dunces, 
Me:,Dunces, no  sorry   you sent us your tech rider with exactly how many microphones you needed on it  we didn t bring any more than that 
Client:,Dunces, oh okay  what about a microphone for this extra guitar amp we bought today 
Me:,Dunces, same problem 
Client:,Dunces, i need a message centre on our new website so i can log in and leave messages for my customers to read  can you build this 
Me:,Dunces, why don t you just send them an email 
Client:,Dunces, because sometimes 
Client:,Dunces, i like what you did here  i m not going to make you change it  but here s what i want you to do 
Client:,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces, i haven t heard back from you regarding the forms 
Me:,Dunces, i haven t received them  sorry  when did you submit them 
Client:,Dunces, i haven t 
Me:,Dunces, can you try and show me where the faulty font is 
Client:,Dunces, they re all over  look at that   
Me:,Dunces, i m very sorry  but what s wrong with it 
Client:,Dunces, it s a different font  it s a different size  it s right there  it hangs lower than the other numbers 
Me:,Dunces, ah  no  that s how georgia is  some characters fall under the centre line  i can assure you  it s the same font and size  
Client:,Dunces, why did you use this f  king font  
Me:,Dunces, because it was the font you chose 
Client:,Dunces, i don t think i did 
Me:,Dunces,  i want george font  don t make me repeat myself   i don t care about the kernling  
Client:,Dunces, don t take that f  king attitude to me  what are you trying to say   
Me:,Dunces, nothing  that s what you said before the first set of revisions  i have your email in front of me  
Client: ,Dunces,clearly  i wanted the george font then  
Me:,Dunces, clearly  
Client:,Dunces, i had an issue with the webinar on monday  hopefully you will fix it for next monday 
Me:,Dunces, i don t do webinars on monday  my live webinars are run every tuesday 
Client:,Dunces, thats fine  as long as it is fixed so i can watch it next monday 
Me:,Dunces, maybe you are misunderstanding me  the reason it seems you had an issue on monday is because there was no webinar on monday  the webinar is on tuesday  so you can t watch it on monday  that is what the issue was 
Client:,Dunces, so 
Client: ,Dunces,i want this to have minimal quality 
Me: ,Dunces,do you mean minimalist 
Client: ,Dunces,i ll tell you what i mean 
Client:,Dunces, yes  but  if you print it with the color printer  
Client:,Dunces, let s meet at     p  sharp 
Me:,Dunces, got it      p  no excuses for tardiness 
Client:,Dunces, but i may be a bit late 
Client:,Dunces, how much does a printed flag cost 
Me:,Dunces, they average about     sq  ft 
Client:,Dunces, a square foot  that s smaller than a foot  right 
Client:,Dunces, the finished product seems to be exactly the same as 
Me:,Dunces, i don t understand the problem  
Client:,Dunces, i had many more ideas that needed to be addressed  i assumed that after my approval of the concept  the real work would begin on a sort of mock up that we would refine into the final product  
Client:,Dunces, when will the magazine be delivered 
Me:,Dunces, not be until tomorrow 
Client:,Dunces, it was supposed to be delivered at the beginning of the month  it s two weeks late 
Me:,Dunces, you said you were fine with the project being delayed while i was away 
Client:,Dunces, yes  but i thought you would have made up that time so it could be delivered on time 
Me:,Dunces, 
Client:,Dunces, couldn t you have finished it while you were away  i said it could wait but i didn t know that meant it would take longer 
Client:,Dunces,  yelling  what took you so long  it s       
Me:,Dunces, i thought you said to arrive at      p 
Client:,Dunces,  yelling  young man  don t you ever dare talking back to a client  if we say        everyone knows you need to be there at       
Me:,Dunces, i apologize for my lack of understanding  i m just trying to 
Client:,Dunces,  yelling  no  be there on time 
Client:,Dunces, what  the f    if i know  just send it already  we re running late  
Me:,Dunces, i need to know where i m have to send this  i don t know 
Client:,Dunces, i told you already  don t start with this crap now  just send the same email to every damn newspaper in town  the one we hired will know 
Client:,Dunces, i ve  noticed that the appearances link is misspelled throughout the site   
Me:,Dunces, all done  anything else i can take care of while i m here 
Client:,Dunces, can you change the link name from appearances to events 
Client:,Dunces, i don t know if you ve been busy with other clients or something  but it s been weeks and i was wondering if you were ever going to get around to uploading that second video to my site 
Me:,Dunces, oh yes  that video has been on your site for a while now  a few weeks at least 
Client: ,Dunces,oh  i guess i 
Me:,Dunces, i ve just received your package  i m a little confused   you ve sent me    dvds and they all appear to have your pc backups on them 
Client:,Dunces, oh yes  good to hear they arrived safely  just choose an image that you think is best for the design 
Me:,Dunces, none of the discs are labelled and they all appear to be complete backups of your computer   some dating back several years  to make things easier  could you let me know in the folder the images are kept 
Client:,Dunces, ok  but you ve finished the webpage now  so you have time 
Me:,Dunces, not enough time to go through all of these dvds  look  sorry if i wasn t clear  i don t know where to look because none of the discs are labelled and they each contain your entire computer backup 
Client,Dunces,  well i m not technical but even i can find them if i google them 
Me:,Dunces, i ve updated that for you 
Client:,Dunces, okay  thanks  let me know when it has been updated 
Me:,Dunces,    
Client:,Dunces, where do you think we should have this ceremony   outside or inside 
Me:,Dunces, inside  since there are no lights outside 
Client:,Dunces, ok  let s do it your way 
Client:,Dunces, we have decided we want to call our new website            com 
Me:,Dunces, unfortunately  the  com is already registered and in use  however   net is available  that s probably the best option unless you choose another name 
Client:,Dunces, ah  yeah  i don t like the  net so much  i think i ll just stick with the  com
Me:,Dunces, sorry  i think you must have misunderstood  the  com is already owned by someone else  you need to pick another name 
Client:,Dunces, thanks for the advice  we ve decided we don t like the  net so we ll just go for the  com 
Client: ,Dunces,i need the sign to be double sided with an arrow pointing to the right 
Me: ,Dunces,you need the arrow pointing to the right on both sides 
Client:,Dunces, yes 
Me:,Dunces, you realize that if the arrow points to the right on both sides  coming from one direction  the arrow will point your target customer in the opposite direction from your location  right 
Client:,Dunces, no  we re on the right 
Me:,Dunces, i know you re on the right coming from this direction  but coming from the other direction the arrow needs to point to the left 
Client:,Dunces, no  we re 
Me,Dunces,  we can add an electronic form to the website so that people can submit their membership application 
Her:,Dunces, okay  sounds good 
Me:,Dunces, who should receive the applications that are submitted through the website  i will need their email address so the submissions can automatically be sent to her 
Her:,Dunces, what submissions  the app gets mailed to  mailing address  
Me:,Dunces, yes  i know  but we re creating an online form for submitting electronically  you approved me putting one on the website  i need an email address for these forms to be sent to 
Her:,Dunces, yes  and thanks 
Client:,Dunces, what does this mean 
Client:,Dunces, it needs to be on green paper 
Me:,Dunces, so then copy it on to green paper 
Client:,Dunces, i need you to send it to me on green paper 
Me:,Dunces, okay  i ll send it via courier asap 
Client:,Dunces, can you just email it to me 
Me:,Dunces, when i email it and you try to print it  it will be on white paper 
Client:,Dunces, it needs to be 
Me:,Dunces, do you have any green paper 
Client:,Dunces, why does that matter 
Me:,Dunces, these are not proportionally equal  things have to be moved around  even with full page to a half page there has to be some tweaking  even if the elements are a high enough resolution for both  one is long and skinny  the other is a bit fatter and shorter  
Client:,Dunces,  in a huff  well  we all can t have the 
*Editor’s Note:,Dunces, proportions and ratios are usually taught by the eighth grade in north america  
Me:,Dunces, it will be about a half hour to an hours worth of work  
Client:,Dunces, that s outrageous  our last it crew could do it in five minutes 
Me:,Dunces, but you said your last crew always went five to ten times over their budgeted time and cost  
Client:,Dunces, six to twelve times  
Me:,Dunces, uh  yeah  that does seem more accurate  
Client:,Dunces, make the logo     the width of the page 
Me:,Dunces, alright  here you go  
Client:,Dunces, woah  woah   what happened 
Me:,Dunces, what do you mean  i did exactly what you asked  it s       
Client:,Dunces, when we said      we didn t 
Me:,Dunces, could your resend that last image again  the file was corrupt and i couldn t open it  i m not even sure what it was an image of 
Client:,Dunces, sure  what did the image look like 
Client: ,Dunces,i need amendments on the website 
Me:,Dunces, ok  what changes would you like to do 
Client: ,Dunces,the size of the header  can you make it   inches tall and   inches wide 
Me: ,Dunces,i am sorry  a website measurement should be in pixels  if you are measuring it by inches  it may look different in my monitor screen resolution compare to yours 
Client: ,Dunces,can t you just 
Client:,Dunces, please change that phrase so that it is all lowercase letters  
Client:,Dunces, no  i wanted it to read like this   like us on facebook  follow us on twitter  
Me:,Dunces, oh ok  so you actually wanted it to be in title case 
Client:,Dunces, 
Me:,Dunces, what do you want the dimensions to be 
Client:,Dunces, i have no idea  like the front side of a hat 
Me:,Dunces, here s a link to the development version of the new site  i m going to develop a separate version for mobile browsing  so if you look at it on a phone  you ll get an error message for now 
Client:,Dunces, it doesn t work 
Me:,Deadbeats, i have an incomplete design that could be modified to suit your needs 
Client:,Deadbeats, will that knock the price down

Client:,Deadbeats, could you create my new website  
Me:,Deadbeats, what kind of budget do you have  
Client:,Deadbeats, well  my friend did this one 
Client: ,Deadbeats,he charged me a beer  so i guess i could give you    euros 
Me:,Deadbeats, ok  for    euros i can tell you all the things you have to learn to create it on your own 
Client: ,Deadbeats,wow  you ll teach me 
Me: ,Deadbeats,no  i ll tell you what you d have to learn  that s worth    euros 
Client:,Deadbeats, i am so glad you are doing this for free  we had to pay thousands of dollars for our old designer 
Me:,Deadbeats,  
Client:,Deadbeats, this is still not what i wanted  i won t pay for this 
Me:,Deadbeats, ok 
Client:,Deadbeats, can you send me the raw files anyway 
Client:,Deadbeats, i can only pay you part time  at an hourly rate  for you to market these luxury homes for our team  we need help with google ads  social media  website development  logos   everything  you ll be our  go to  person for all things marketing  we know how important social media and other digital strategies are for gaining maximum exposure  our clients expect top quality work 
Me:,Deadbeats, sounds interesting  the pay you described is pretty low for the work  though 
Client:,Deadbeats, we have a specific budget allocated for this position  this job is a great stepping stone for someone looking to build their career  though  you will be a very important part of our team 
Client:,Deadbeats, i am a first time self publisher and writer looking for a proofreader  i m writing in the ap style  i am looking to pair with someone just beginning as a proofreader  just as i am starting as a self published writer 
Me:,Deadbeats, great  i m more experienced than just starting out  but i d love to help you with your book  here are my rates  
Client:,Deadbeats, oh  i was just hoping i could proofread something for you in return  
Client: ,Deadbeats,we were looking through your credentials and you seem to be exactly what we re looking for  we have about    images that we need to be shopped and edited so that we can create a series to pull from for future campaigns  just general images       x     pixels  but they definitely need some reworking  we were hoping to have them all done within a month 
Client,Deadbeats,  i want a website for my company with all these features  i have a       budget   send me a proposal 
Me,Deadbeats,  here is how much it will cost for your website  i ll need a monthly retainer for hosting and maintenance 
Client,Deadbeats,  i can t pay you in full but here is      to tide you over  i still want these features done  and a logo and for you to set up emails too 
Client,Deadbeats,  i m going to bring you on as a consultant and pay you    k per year to manage our website
Client,Deadbeats,  my emails no longer work  i m in the process of finalizing a million dollar deal wtf 
Me,Deadbeats,  your domain name is expired  you need to send me money to pay for it 
Client,Deadbeats,  wtf  i m going to sue you if you don t renew the domain by monday 
Me:,Deadbeats, the website is done  we can bring the cd tomorrow  we only accept payment in cash as per the contract  please have the money on hand  in the mean time we are setting up the hosting for you 
Me: ,Deadbeats,no  we can wait for when you have the money and finalize it then  we re still setting up the hosting anyway  so if it will take you a week or two to arrange payment that s fine  
Client: ,Deadbeats, click 
Me: ,Deadbeats,there s been quite a delay in payment  i know the company is well funded   why the wait  
Client: ,Deadbeats, no  it s not the rate  that s fine  it s the hours  a lot of the work didn t you did didn t wind up in the final product   
Me: ,Deadbeats,i m working a ton of extra hours for this client  
Client: ,Deadbeats,we don t pay extra time  this is just normal for agency life  
Me:,Deadbeats,  replying to a public inquiry that included a budget  hi  i m able develop the site for you  here are my references    however  it would require a bigger budget  can you do xxx 
Client,Deadbeats,  thank you for your quote  however  this is my  th time inquiring for the site and i ve gotten a lot of different quotes  i know it s possible to develop it in the stated budget 
Me: ,Deadbeats,but you haven t hired anyone in that time 
Client: ,Deadbeats,it can be done  goodbye  
Client:,Deadbeats, we can only pay you a low hourly wage 
Client:,Deadbeats, a big part of the day to day involves driving around the city to meet with businesses and other organizations  you ll make speeches  establish partnerships  and help raise funds 
Me:,Deadbeats, are the mileage and gas covered by the group 
Client:,Deadbeats, no 
Client,Deadbeats,  for the next project  we would like to have longer payment terms  we don t understand the problem  we have clients of our own that pay only after   months 
Me,Deadbeats,  my company is just me and i need to be able to pay my bills  too  i expect clients to pay their invoices on time 
Client,Deadbeats,  if i knew you were living on bread and water  i would consider paying you earlier 
Me: ,Deadbeats,no 
 Client: ,Deadbeats,okay  that s fine  but we still need the final paper translated and edited  can you do that 
Client:,Deadbeats, can you speed things up and lower the price 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i can hurry things along  but i m not changing the price   
Client:,Deadbeats, this was overpriced  i m going to pay what i think is fair  
Client:,Deadbeats, send me two quotes to bill your job   hourly and flat fee  then i ll choose which one i want 
Me:,Deadbeats, no 
Client:,Deadbeats, no 
Me:,Deadbeats, you don t get to choose how i bill you  that s my choice  i m going to send you a flat fee rate for my services  if you approve  i ll send you a contract  and we can move forward 
Client:,Deadbeats, then how will i know which is cheaper 
Me:,Deadbeats, it s not an option  you are paying for the value of the project  not how much time i spend on it  
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t have to use you 
Me:,Deadbeats, no  you don t  
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t have to use you 
Me:,Deadbeats,  again  no  you don t  and i m not desperate for work  so whatever you want to do is fine with me 
Client: ,Deadbeats,can you draw from this photo  if you did this and shared it to my social media feed your following will definitely double  
Me:,Deadbeats, i m currently taking commission bookings if that s something you re interested in 
Client: ,Deadbeats,i was thinking that it would be a charitable donation  it would be really popular with my audience and i m absolutely certain it would get you lots of sales 
Client: ,Deadbeats,we could even get my audience to make decisions about the creative direction of the piece  there could even be a promotional campaign where a percentage of the profits from your future sales goes into my charity  
Me,Deadbeats,  i can t work for free  i m very sorry  
Client: ,Deadbeats,oh  okay  
I Should Bail! Moment #1,Deadbeats,none
Me:,Deadbeats, where did the image come from  make sure it isn t copyrighted 
Client: ,Deadbeats,it isn t copyrighted  they came from the internet  
Me: ,Deadbeats,honestly an original design is always safer  i will be working on the brochure next  the design process takes time so if he could give me until next week i would appreciate it  the result will be better in the long run 
Client: ,Deadbeats,well we made it from things we found on the internet  so we should be fine  
I Should Bail! Moment #2,Deadbeats,none
Me:,Deadbeats, do you want me to work on the business card design next 
Client:,Deadbeats, no  he wants to play with the design himself   
I Should Bail! Moment #3 ,Deadbeats,none
Client:,Deadbeats, we want visuals that evoke emotions  include images of the titanic on the brochure  
I Should Bail! Moment #4,Deadbeats,none
Me:,Deadbeats, do you know what quantity you want to print 
Client:,Deadbeats, no 
Me:,Deadbeats, we should find that out first so we can get some cost estimates 
Client:,Deadbeats, just finish it  you should be able to figure this out 
They bailed! Moment #1,Deadbeats,none
Client:,Deadbeats, we went a totally different direction on the brochure  we decided not to use boats or water at all  
Me:,Deadbeats, what  that s everything you told me you wanted  
Client: ,Deadbeats,yeah  we re just going to do it in house  
Client:,Deadbeats, we don t participate in late fees for unpaid invoices 
Me:,Deadbeats, participation isn t mandatory  but payment is   
Client:,Deadbeats, i love the logo  great work 
Me:,Deadbeats, awesome  as soon as i get the final     of the payment  i will send you all the hi res files for you to use  
Client:,Deadbeats, is it urgent   cause i m not in any rush 
Me:,Deadbeats, yeah  i m in no rush to buy food or anything  
Client: ,Deadbeats,can you make these changes 
Me: ,Deadbeats,those are significant changes that are basically another new project  they will cost      
Client: ,Deadbeats, furious  what is this  you told me the project would be      
Me: ,Deadbeats,what  no  i told you it would be        with additional charges 
Client: ,Deadbeats,no  you said        and then when i wanted changes you lowered the price to       
Me: ,Deadbeats,so you think when faced with doing more work i lowered the fee  
Client: ,Deadbeats,well what you did definitely isn t worth        
Client: ,Deadbeats,we will entertain a commission based fee only  we don t pay for activities  we pay for results 
Me:,Deadbeats, what s your budget 
Client:,Deadbeats, about      a month  i don t want to pay anything more than i need to 
Me:,Deadbeats, that s not very much  it could cost you a lot more to see the results you are seeking  but the roi could be worth it  how much are you willing to pay someone to work on this marketing project  there are a lot of other considerations and topics to discuss  such as seo and your social media strategy 
Client:,Deadbeats, i am looking to pay someone about     per hour  no more than   hours per week  you re not charging me for this conversation  are you 
Client:,Deadbeats, i want ten 
Client:,Deadbeats,  let s meet near my house because i have to pick up suzy from school
Client:,Deadbeats,  visibly upset  you charge this much for your little drawings  and you say i only have the rights to use these images for this project  and not for upcoming ones  
Me: ,Deadbeats,we can negotiate future use of the characters  but if you want future use of the intellectual property that will cost more   
Client: ,Deadbeats, indignant  goodbye  
Client:,Deadbeats, i need to make more money to support my family  and i don t have much savings to buy another vehicle  what do you think i should do 
Me:,Deadbeats, well  there are various options 
Client:,Deadbeats, what do you think of a kickstarter campaign 
Me:,Deadbeats, it might work if it was marketed really well online 
Client:,Deadbeats, ok  let s do that 
Me:,Deadbeats, how much could you pay me per month to work on this marketing project 
Client:,Deadbeats,      per month 
Me:,Deadbeats, uh  hmm 
Client:,Deadbeats, that much  that s too much 
Me:,Deadbeats, well  it s very physical work  and i would need to recover afterward  it s different from a desk job 
Client:,Deadbeats, here are some rags 
Client:,Deadbeats, stop texting me 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i will need to take the issue to small claims court if i don t hear back from you in a week with payment 
Client:,Deadbeats, you didn t even clean my house that well  i hired another housekeeper who did a much better job than you 
Client:,Deadbeats, the style guide is for 
Me:,Deadbeats, that s a big deal  do you have the logos ready and other information i would need to create the style guide 
Client: ,Deadbeats, i ll need you to communicate with the freelance designer about the status of the logos  there are four logo drafts in progress  look up the university online to learn more about them and their goals  you can also research some style guides that other universities have created to get a feel for what they did 
Me:,Deadbeats, hmm  well  i think i would need more information from the people who you have worked with at the university to understand what they are seeking  this could also take a lot of research and planning  how much is in your budget for this style guide project 
Clients:,Deadbeats, we can only pay you     per hour 
Me:,Deadbeats, ok  since i am doing most of the work from home and i can still work as a freelancer in my spare time  this might work 
Clients:,Deadbeats, we are going to need you to drive across town to meet with us once or twice a week 
Me:,Deadbeats, the amount it would cost for me in terms of gas and mileage for me to drive across town to discuss these projects with you isn t worth it for me  i don t think this is the job i am seeking at this time 
Clients:,Deadbeats, well  we need you to be collaborative with us  we ll work with you  are you planning on working completely remotely then 
Me:,Deadbeats,    i m planning on not working for you at all  
Client:,Deadbeats, yeah  i don t have time for that  i just need to make some money quick by marketing this vacation home on facebook  also  i need you to help me market this diner i just bought  
Me: ,Deadbeats,okay   
Client:,Deadbeats, oh  by the way  my credit card is maxed out  since i am paying for the food for the restaurant out of pocket  i need to make more money off of my vacation rental and this diner  but don t worry  i ll still pay you 
Me:,Deadbeats, ok  well  this is a little concerning  by the way  the website for your restaurant needs a lot of work 
Client:,Deadbeats, i just had that created  i guess that s what i get for being so cheap 
Client:,Deadbeats, do i need to submit a deposit 
Me:,Deadbeats, yes  i will require  x before beginning the project  i can accept either a check or a paypal payment 
Client:,Deadbeats, paypal won t work for me  my credit card company won t allow it  can you use  sketchy company i have never heard of  
Me:,Deadbeats, no  but i can use intuit  would that work for you 
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  please invoice me and process the charge 
Client:,Deadbeats, i m sorry but can you help me  i need to pay       to my writing consultant but don t have the money  can i pay you the amount and your deposit through my credit card to forward to him 
Me: ,Deadbeats,great  so the logo should take around     hours at my rate of  xx 
Client: ,Deadbeats,okay  but i don t want to pay more than that  
Me:,Deadbeats, sure  i m confident i can create a logo in that time frame quoted 
Client: ,Deadbeats,wait  how many options will i get 
Me: ,Deadbeats,the quote above is for one logo  it takes around     hours  if you want more  i can create options  but i ll have to bill each at     hours for a total of  xxx 
Client: ,Deadbeats,that is not a competitive market rate  best of luck 
Client:,Deadbeats, how much do you charge to 
Me:,Deadbeats,      
Client:,Deadbeats, would you do it for      
Me:,Deadbeats, are we haggling 
Client:,Deadbeats, um  yeah    i guess so 
Me:,Deadbeats, okay  let s start again 
Client:,Deadbeats, pardon 
Me:,Deadbeats, ask me again  i didn t realize we were haggling 
Client:,Deadbeats, okay    um    how much do you charge to photograph my apartment for airbnb 
Me:,Deadbeats,      
Client:,Deadbeats, our
Me: ,Deadbeats,yeah  it could be a lot better  it will need a redesign as part of what you ve discussed for the new campaign 
Client: ,Deadbeats,yep  it s really disappointing they left   they offered us free changes for a year in their price  which we paid in full and upfront  serves us right for hiring a college kid  i guess 
Client: ,Deadbeats,nice try with the quote  but we caught you 
Me: ,Deadbeats,huh 
Client:,Deadbeats, you try sneaking in a few for the website as well  we ve already paid for it  so we won t pay again 
Me:,Deadbeats, we ve never worked together before  so we ve never had any payments from you 
Client:,Deadbeats, bulls  t  i know you creative millennials are all leftie socialist pigs  living your communal lifestyles on the back of hard working folk like us  we ve paid you once for the website and like f    we re going to pay you again 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i don t think we re a good fit for each other  i ll see myself out 
Client,Deadbeats,  no  no  we ll pay 
Me:,Deadbeats, hi  guys  just wondering where things on your side 
 Client: ,Deadbeats,we re an educational software company  we re in search of an animator who animates in either  d or  d  the first animation will be unpaid but the subsequent animation work will be paid at the rate you give us   what we want 
Client: ,Deadbeats,here at  website  we believe in paying contributors for their work and have a patreon campaign for this  the amount raised each month from our patrons is divided evenly between all articles on the site that month and      of the money from patreon goes to the writers  as such for each article published on the site our writers receive between      per article 
Me:,Deadbeats, hi  i d love to apply to your listing  here are my rates  
Client:,Deadbeats, i love it  but i don t have the money any more so i can t pay you  
Me:,Deadbeats, that s a shame  well  let me know if you come into the money  i d love to help  
Client:,Deadbeats, it was supposed to be a gift for my aunt  she has cancer  you know  
Me: ,Deadbeats,i m sorry to hear that 
Client: ,Deadbeats,she just really wanted this  but i can t afford to pay anyone  why isn t anyone charitable 
Me: ,Deadbeats,well  i m asking for commissions to help support my family  our grandma died a few days ago and she was the lynch pin of our family 
Client: ,Deadbeats,so we d like to pay you on a sliding scale of            depending on how much we like the music you compose for us 
Me: ,Deadbeats,part of my fee includes revisions to make sure the music i write meets your requirements and is to your liking  so no 
Client: ,Deadbeats,tell you what   why don t we call it       and if we really like your music  we ll throw in that last      as a bonus 
Client: ,Deadbeats,would you be willing to barter  i could hand out your business card at the event  
Client: ,Deadbeats,hey  i know this use last minute but i need you to come do my make up today  i m about an hour away in a neighboring town  and i ll need you to volunteer your time  but i can give you some photos as payment 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i m happy to add these features  but i m going to charge my hourly rate in addition to what we agreed while implementing them 
Client: ,Deadbeats,fine  
Client: ,Deadbeats,oh  we didn t respond because we thought that ridiculously high invoice was an april fool s joke  
Me: ,Deadbeats,hey  i m just letting you know i got paypal together so i can accept payment for that commission now  
Client: ,Deadbeats,oh wow  it s been a while  haha  i ll get on that 
Client:,Deadbeats,  upset  look  i know the payment is important to you  it s just tough getting it to you so long after i was supposed to pay you  
Me: ,Deadbeats,if this moment is difficult for you  i understand that  do you know when you ll be able to pay me  
Client: ,Deadbeats,it s hard for me to pay at the moment  anyway when you buy something it should happen right then  not when i need the money for something else  
Me: ,Deadbeats,you agreed to pay me when my paypal was back up  if you weren t comfortable with that you could have said no  
Client: ,Deadbeats,well it s your fault for taking so long  i don t want to pay for something this long after i get it 
Client: ,Deadbeats,i saw your advertisement for  d modeling services  can i see your past work in blender 
Me: ,Deadbeats,sure 
Client: ,Deadbeats,do you work with animate games 
Me: ,Deadbeats,no  i haven t animated before  sorry 
Client:,Deadbeats, no  animate games  they made games on roblox like one piece  
Me: ,Deadbeats,no  i haven t  
Client: ,Deadbeats,can you make stuff like these  
Me:,Deadbeats, might take a while  but i can do that for you 
Client:,Deadbeats, how much do you charge  or is it free 
Me:,Deadbeats, about     an hour  pretty cheap if you ask me 
Client: ,Deadbeats,i know better people than you  and they do it cheaper  i guess you can t work for me 
Me:,Deadbeats, all right 
Client: ,Deadbeats,if you have a minute and won t charge me    like my lawyer is by the minute right now  i was wondering how serious is this language in a contract
Client: ,Deadbeats,hey not sure if you got a chance to t
Client:,Deadbeats, i am paying to keep my restaurant open with credit cards  but don t worry  i still have money to pay you 
Me:,Deadbeats, ok    thanks for letting me know 
Client:,Deadbeats, i really need you to market my vacation home on facebooks so i can earn more money 
Me:,Deadbeats, i don t know if that would work  but we can try  a website could help  and you might want to do e mail campaigns as well 
Client:,Deadbeats, whatever  ok  i need this to work  how about facebook ads  no one knows about my restaurant  i might need to change the menu  the prices  and the website for that  oh god  i don t have time for any of this 
Client:,Deadbeats, i need an aerial photo of the city for an ad 
Me:,Deadbeats, all right  that will be  quotes price  
Client:,Deadbeats, that s double what i can get it for on a stock website  i was going to do you a favor and pay you  half of what he said the website wanted  
Me:,Deadbeats, so you re telling me you want to pay me half of what a stock website wants and you re calling it a favor  
Client:,Deadbeats, now you re just trying to make me sound like a jerk 
Me:,Deadbeats, i just repeated what you said back to you  
Client:,Deadbeats, fine  i ll just download something off of google for free 
Me: ,Deadbeats,to restore this with a new print will cost  x  
Client: ,Deadbeats,wow  that s expensive  i don t know if it s worth it 
Me:,Deadbeats, well  it s up to you if the photo is important enough to have it restored 
Client: ,Deadbeats,how about you restore it and i ll decide what i m willing to pay for it 
Me: ,Deadbeats, uhm  no  this is my price to restore it based on the amount of time i ll spend on it   also  i need payment in advance 
Client: ,Deadbeats, i m not going to pay until i see if it s worth the money  i know it s all automatic on the computer so i shouldn t have to pay much  i can just download an app or something that will do it  but i thought i would support a local business 
Me: ,Deadbeats, well  it isn t automatic  i have to do everything by hand in photoshop  in this case  i ll need to rebuild parts of both faces  that s not an easy fix  if you can find a program that can do what i do as well as i do it  let me know  not only will i buy it  but i ll pay you for finding it for me 
Client:,Deadbeats,  blank stare 
Me:,Deadbeats, do you want to leave the print for me to restore   i can ring you up now 
Client:,Deadbeats, yeah  right  that should be okay  i ll need to speak with my producer first  
Me:,Deadbeats, haha  yeah that s fine 
Client:,Deadbeats, like  i just bought a taxidermy cat on ebay and that was our entire prop budget  also  do you mind not telling the other crew that i m paying you 
Me:,Deadbeats, here s the presentation 
Client:,Deadbeats, i like it 
Client:,Deadbeats, i never really liked it  it s not what i expected  it s not worth the money 
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t like it  make the text in the middle bigger  but leave the blue box around the word the same 
Me:,Deadbeats, i can t do that  i have to scale the full object or else it would go against your branding standard and eps you sent us  it would look wrong 
Client:,Deadbeats, those don t apply to this  why is this so hard for you  a designer  to understand  just make the text bigger and leave the box the same 
Me:,Deadbeats, i m going to have to get you to 
Client:,Deadbeats, we need this installed next week  i don t have time to argue with you  just make it the way i asked 
Client:,Deadbeats, this looks horrible  why didn t you tell me it would look so different  
Client:,Deadbeats, well i m not paying for this  it looks completely wrong 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i see you paid me  but you owe me        not the          you transferred me  how did you come up with that number 
Client: ,Deadbeats,we actually lost your time card and had no idea how much we owed you  we just picked a random number and gave it to you  do you like the    cents 
Client: ,Deadbeats,our client doesn t like it  he wants to keep using his old  table based layout  website  can you just align the photos with the text  oh  and since 
Client: ,Deadbeats,sorry  but we 
Me: ,Deadbeats,but we emailed the invoice to you a month ago 
Client: ,Deadbeats,yes  well  i never received it or you would have been paid by now 
Me: ,Deadbeats,but you emailed back thanking me for the invoice and saying you would pay it immediately  please see attached  i included a copy of their email  
Me:,Deadbeats, your invoice is now more than two months overdue  as you know  i went against my usual policy and made your website live before receiving payment as a special favor  but i m afraid 
Client:,Deadbeats, but we need the website  it s our best marketing tool  and we re just entering our busiest time of the year 
Me:,Deadbeats, i understand  and if you can make payment straight away that s no problem  otherwise  i m afraid i will take the site down 
Client:,Deadbeats, that s so unprofessional of you  forget it   we ll find someone else to deal with our website  i assume we can have the design  the text and all the images etc since that was what we hired you for and you signed a contract to deliver  right 
Client:,Deadbeats, are you able to help me out with more design work over the next couple of months 
Me:,Deadbeats, i can do that  i need the money 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh  well  can i pay you per piece 
Me:,Deadbeats, sure  here is a list of rates 
Client:,Deadbeats, ok  
Me:,Deadbeats, sorry  but i simply won t accept any more bookings from you until you pay your last two invoices  they re both more than a month past due 
Client:,Deadbeats, well it s just unprofessional of you to leave us hanging like this 
Me:,Deadbeats, i m sorry  but getting paid for your work is kind of the definition of professional 
Client,Deadbeats,  so the concert was canceled  but we managed to find another artist for the same day  can you make us the flyers and everything else 
Me,Deadbeats,  sure  but i still need you to pay me for making the poster for the one that got cancelled 
Client,Deadbeats,  but it was cancelled  besides  you didn t spend anything on the job  except some time 
Me,Deadbeats,  well  i spent   weeks on it while attending university  and the job is completely done 
Client,Deadbeats,  well  we are not going to pay that  and the next one  we need it in less than a week and 
Client:,Deadbeats, visiting websites is free so making websites should also be free 
Me:,Deadbeats,  
Client:,Deadbeats, i m already paying  big isp name  for 
Me:,Deadbeats, you can pay here  paypal link 
Client:,Deadbeats, haha  no  you should ve gotten me to 
Me:,Deadbeats, i did 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh well i m still not paying 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh come on  we re a pretty well known business  instead of  paying you the full amount  i can give you some exposure  you people are always looking for 
Me: ,Deadbeats,with all due respect  sir  i would much prefer you just give me my pay and leave it at that  i have all the exposure i need right now short of being naked  not to mention that this was a relatively small job for me 
Client: ,Deadbeats,but it was a      word document 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i normally edit documents in excess of    pages  and i normally expect more than what you re paying me 
Client: ,Deadbeats,fuck you  i ll sue you for being a prick 
Me:,Deadbeats, you never actually read my contract before you signed it  did you 
Client: ,Deadbeats,what 
Me: ,Deadbeats,see you in court  have fun paying for my lawyer 
Client:,Deadbeats, i m disgusted about you sending these past due marked invoices via my fax machine 
Me:,Deadbeats, i apologize that you are upset  i could not get any response from you in my previous efforts so i reached out via fax 
Client:,Deadbeats, well i don t appreciate you marking this invoice past due in bold letters  you make it look like we don t pay our bills 
Me:,Deadbeats, i didn t mean to offend you  however the invoice is nearing   months past due and you haven t responded to any of my calls or letters 
Client:,Deadbeats,  very angry  i am telling you i don t care if they are past due  you insult us by making it appear that we don t pay our bills on time and besides  i never got this invoice until today 
Me:,Deadbeats, ok  i have documented here all the times i ve attempted to reach you  i have called x amount of times  sent x amount of letters and left x amount of messages  did you not receive all the invoices marked past due in red these past few months 
Client:,Deadbeats, well  i just threw them out without opening them  i don t have time for that s    
Client:,Deadbeats, these are great  just make them a little longer  and we ll be good to go 
Me:,Deadbeats, those are sample tracks  the real product is the full length  how do you want to work out payment  i ll take checks or by paypal  but checks will take a little longer to confirm payment for me  since i have a policy of not sending the tracks until i get paid  
Client:,Deadbeats, wait  what  you must be new to this  you pay us to use your tracks  you re a professional  you should know this  isn t that how this works  
Me:,Deadbeats, absolutely not  you pay me for the rights to use this track once and only once in this commercial  i don t do work for free  and there s no way in hell i m paying someone to use my tracks  
Client:,Deadbeats, but that s       i can t afford that 
Me:,Deadbeats, then you shouldn t have signed the contract  no money  no tracks 
Client:,Deadbeats, can t you do this for free  
Me:,Deadbeats, that s nice  but that still doesn t give you a discount on my music  why is this such an issue anyways  you supposedly work for a big budget production house  it costs more to record the voiceover than my tracks cost  
Client:,Deadbeats, well   yes  but it s not for the production house  this is for my class 
Me:,Deadbeats,  excuse me 
Me:,Deadbeats, hello client  just curious to what payment date works best for you  regards 
Client:,Deadbeats, i just sent      last month  what s your expectation for this month 
Me:,Deadbeats, we agreed on       each month until your balance is paid in full 
Client:,Deadbeats, really dude  just relax  i m packing my stuff to leave tomorrow 
Me:,Deadbeats, okay back to my original question  a chosen date 
Client:,Deadbeats, headed to crossfit  
Me:,Deadbeats, i ll send a statement accompanied by an invoice  signing off for the night 
Client:,Deadbeats, i see what kind of business you really run  no guarantees and a shitload of empty words  golden 
Client,Deadbeats,  how much is a website 
Me,Deadbeats,  there s not really a good answer for that  i mean  how much is a car 
Client,Deadbeats,  cars  what  no  we need a web site  that s why we brought you here 
Me,Deadbeats,  i understand that  well  the last site i did came in around         under my quote  i might add 
Client,Deadbeats,  oh wow  that s way beyond our budget  ridiculous  how much would it be for say  half that so you can teach us while you build it and we can do the other half 
Me,Deadbeats,  how much is half a car 
Client:,Deadbeats, hi  i saw your quote and i did a bit of research  i know people who charge r    per hour for design work  so i think you should give me the same rate 
Me:,Deadbeats, well my rate is based on many factors so i am unfortunately not able to reduce it 
Client:,Deadbeats, i tell you what  if you only do the business cards  brochures and signage for me and charge r    per hour  i will refer you to all of my business contacts  
Me:,Deadbeats, i can re quote you on producing just those items but like i said  my hourly rate is not negotiable  it is in fact  already discounted because you mentioned your financial situation was a bit unstable 
Client:,Deadbeats, ok  so here is what we do  you do the work for me at the rate i want to pay you and then we can talk about doing future projects together  i have a lot i want to do  besides  if i could find someone who was willing to do it for cheaper  then you should be able to do it for cheaper as well 
CLIENT:,Deadbeats, this artwork is fabulous  i couldn t have asked for more   it s exactly what we wanted  now  for the next job 
ME:,Deadbeats, i m glad you like them  but just to let you know that my rates have changed  sorry   i doubt i can afford to take on another job at what i offered you last time 
CLIENT:,Deadbeats, ok  that s understandable  what s the price 
CLIENT:,Deadbeats, really  for this  do you really think it s worth that 
Client:,Deadbeats, we are not offering to pay you for this  we just want to see how you work  this project shouldn t take you more than   hours to complete 
Recruiter:,Deadbeats, they ve decided not to hire you because you didn t follow the style guide 
Client:,Deadbeats, i ll pay your deposit and then you can get started with the script 
Me:,Deadbeats, i apologize for missing your call  can we talk today 
Client:,Deadbeats, you re clearly not      dedicated to my project  your website says you don t make excuses  clearly you re full of it 
Client:,Deadbeats, listen  send me that script today  no excuses 
Me:,Deadbeats, sure  once you ve sent the deposit  i ll get right on it 
Client:,Deadbeats, hey there  sorry i wasn t able to pay your deposit  
Client,Deadbeats,  i just paid this company xxx money and they were supposed to design a custom website  
Me,Deadbeats,  oh really 
Client,Deadbeats,  yeah  they stuck us in a template 
Me,Deadbeats,  oh  wow 
Client,Deadbeats,  i called the jerk to let him know i wasn t giving him any more money  seriously  go to the demo site and look at it  
Client,Deadbeats,  now you tell me it s not a template  they forgot to remove it and tried to make use pay thousands of dollars for this crap  i don t think so 
Me,Deadbeats,  hmm 
Client:,Deadbeats, i have a big cash job to price but they need a visual to give an idea of the finished job
Me:,Deadbeats, ok  no problem  since your finances are tight i will do it for a nominal fee of           and you ll pay me if you get the job 
Me:,Deadbeats, was the visual ok  did your client like it 
Client: ,Deadbeats,they loved it  i got the job 
Me,Deadbeats,  so that s     you owe me then 
Client:,Deadbeats, why should i pay you  you have 
Client:,Deadbeats, i hate it 
Me:,Deadbeats, i m sorry  may i ask why 
Client:,Deadbeats, the grammar  is all wrong  is terrible  pay you no 
Client:,Deadbeats, hey it s me  i just got word that i can t use the girl s image in the poster because we don t have the copyright  here is another image  can you get it to me by  am 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i don t think i can get it to you that early  i have work at     am and i just woke up  i have to get ready to go in 
Client: ,Deadbeats,can you try 
Me:,Deadbeats, i can try  but because it is such short notice  i am charging for revisions and 
Client:,Deadbeats, wait  why do i have to pay you again 
Me:,Deadbeats, i take it your happy with the end result  can i lock the project 
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  it s very nice  what do you mean by locking it 
Me:,Deadbeats, as in  my job is done  so i ll send you the bill and we shake hands 
Client:,Deadbeats, right  well  i need my friends to look at it 
Me:,Deadbeats, no problem  but note that i don t do extra work on a project before i ve gotten paid for the initial job 
Client:,Deadbeats, you might need to change the entire design and functionality  i m not going to pay you for something i don t want 
Client:,Deadbeats, here is a design i created  it has a skate theme  
Me:,Deadbeats,  sorry  i don t remember asking you for any designs  we love it  but it s not really what we are looking for  thanks though 
Client:,Deadbeats, as i can see you have not put     into my paypal  please do this asap as i have spent a long time on it  if you do not  i will have to get others involved  
Me:,Deadbeats, i m very sorry  but i never commissioned anything from you 
Client:,Deadbeats, i ve had enough  you didn t ask for it  but that doesn t excuse late payment  if you do not have the resources  you can send clothing out to me  or  i can and will get lawyers involved 
Me:,Deadbeats, here s the working copy  is there anything you think can be improved 
Client:,Deadbeats, eh  there are a couple things  but it s good enough 
Me:,Deadbeats, if you give me specifics  i can change what you think is wrong 
Client:,Deadbeats, you did the best you could  i m sure you tried your hardest 
How to build a publication on the back of a designer…,Deadbeats,none
Client:,Deadbeats, here are the keywords we want the content to focus on 
Me:,Deadbeats, i m afraid 
Client:,Deadbeats, okay  that is fine  just use the ones you think are best 
Client:,Deadbeats, i will not pay for this  you did not follow my instructions  i sent you plenty of keywords and you only used four  don t bother offering to revise  i will find someone else 
Client:,Deadbeats, hey  we need a digital artist to color a sketch one of our guys made  it s the eight of us as superheroes  would you be able to do that 
Me:,Deadbeats, yes  but eight characters would take time to color 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh  that s okay  we need it next week  how does    sound 
Client:,Deadbeats,    
Client: ,Deadbeats,there s a problem with 
Me:,Deadbeats, oh  what s the problem 
Client:,Deadbeats, well  i can t actually pay it  you see  the thing is that i knew i didn t have the money when i got you to do the job but   and i might not have mentioned this   i m a big believer in the laws of attraction  so  anyway  i told the universe that i needed to manifest the money to pay you  but it turns out the universe wasn t listening  don t worry  i m going to work really hard on manifesting when i get back  i ll pay you as soon as i can 
Me:,Deadbeats, back from where 
Client:,Deadbeats, from holiday  did i not tell you  it s so exciting   my husband and i are going to a resort for three weeks  the universe decided we need a break 
Client:,Deadbeats, everything looks fine and we would like to work with you   under one condition  could you please remove the line about the corrections 
Me:,Deadbeats, the two corrections per  predefined  project stage 
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  we don t feel comfortable with limiting the amount of corrections 
Me:,Deadbeats, no problem  this will not be a fixed estimate then  i ll change it to the hourly rate and keep you informed of my time spent on the project 
Client:,Deadbeats, no  we don t like that  as a professional you should know exactly how many hours you will be working on this 
Me:,Deadbeats, so  fixed time  with unlimited corrections that could take an unknown amount of time 
Client:,Deadbeats, yes 
Client:,Deadbeats, 
Me:,Deadbeats, i d have to list each step i took in flash which would mean me teaching you how to use the software first 
Client:,Deadbeats, if you could do that  it would be great 
Client:,Deadbeats, hey  i m taking some ehow classes in all that s    you were charging me for so i can do it myself  the only thing i need to know is if you would happen to have a spare copy of this  adobe s creative s suites  that i could use           
Client:,Deadbeats, what about if instead of your fixed fee  we gave you a percentage on our profits  you might get more money  and you ll be more motivated to do a great job 
Me:,Deadbeats, aren t you going to make it 
Client:,Deadbeats, yeah  so what about it 
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t understand why you can t start coding
Me:,Deadbeats, as i said on our last call and via email  there are invoices due before we start  you need to pay those first 
Client:,Deadbeats, why are you being so difficult  just start and then i ll pay you 
Me:,Deadbeats, as i said  i cannot start without payment 
Client:,Deadbeats, if i knew you were going to be so inflexible  i wouldn t have worked with you  i hate people who always follow their contracts 
Me:,Deadbeats, i m sorry you feel that way  
Client:,Deadbeats, so will you start coding today 
Me:,Deadbeats, yes  if you 
Me: ,Deadbeats,we are not inclined to print any of these menus for free  considering we did not design them  if they would still like for us to print them  it will be  xxxx total 
Client: ,Deadbeats,please print the      burger menus and      kids menus for delivery tomorrow  i spoke with my boss  and if we can do this initial run at no charge  i will let him know the value of this effort and that it will cost him this amount for future runs 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i don t think you understand   we will not be printing the menus for free that someone else designed  please let me know if they are willing to accept the costs 
Client: ,Deadbeats,i don t think they will  we already committed to printing them for free  
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t understand why there was a shipping fee on this invoice  last time i worked with you there was no shipping fee 
Me:,Deadbeats, if you remember  we agreed that if your order was over      i can offer you the shipping for free 
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  i do  but this invoice is for     and it has a shipping fee on it 
Me:,Deadbeats, because it was under     before the shipping fee 
Client:,Deadbeats, but you said anything over     would be free to ship 
Me:,Deadbeats, yes  anything more than     before the shipping fee is added 
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t understand 
Client: ,Deadbeats,can you show one of the english professors how to make it 
Me: ,Deadbeats,okay  when do you want it done  also  i would want to remind you that my price is fixed at      
Client: ,Deadbeats,oh no  you don t understand  we want you to show it to him so he can make it 
Client:,Deadbeats, everything is looking really good  can you go ahead and move the site to my server 
Me:,Deadbeats, absolutely  i ll send you an invoice and move it over as soon as i receive final payment 
Client:,Deadbeats, hey man  why isn t the site on my server yet 
Me:,Deadbeats, 
Client:,Deadbeats, after reviewing the site you have been developing  we have decided that it is not the quality that we are expecting  per our contract  you can either move the site to our server or refund the initial deposit 
Me:,Deadbeats, i don t remember the contract stating that i built you a website for half price  also  if you hate the quality  why did you say it was looking good earlier  and why would you want it on your server 
Client:,Deadbeats, are you sure you re experienced enough to handle this 
Me:,Deadbeats, yes  i ve translated contracts before  i am 
Client:,Deadbeats, great  so  my client only wants to pay around     bucks for the translation  
Me:,Deadbeats, you do realize that the actual translation would be worth at least four times that  right 
Client: ,Deadbeats,  and they want it done by five pm 
Me:,Deadbeats, thank you for your call  there is no way that i can translate a contract of    pages for within   hours for so little money  
Client:,Deadbeats, c mon  it should be easy for you 
Client:,Deadbeats, we want you to redeliver the illustrations for the new version  the proportions are different  so you probably have to change the composition of each page  and we need you to redo all the illustrations  because we actually didn t like them at all in the first book  make them more beautiful  with more details  like a real illustrator would  
Me:,Deadbeats, wait  the budget for the first book was proposed by you  and all illustrations were happily approved after some corrections  and now you want me to redo the whole book for free  
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  the whole project depends on you 
Me:,Deadbeats, did you decide on which proof you liked 
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t know  what did you like  i like a but some people like b  
Me:,Deadbeats, i like b 
Client:,Deadbeats, okay let s do both  that way  we can see what they both look like in finished form 
Me:,Deadbeats, okay  but that will effect either the deadline or your invoice  likely both 
Client:,Deadbeats, what  why 
Me:,Deadbeats, because i d be doing twice as much work 
Client:,Deadbeats, and that entitles you to twice as much pay 
Me:,Deadbeats, um  yes 
Me:,Deadbeats, based on everything we ve talked about  i estimate this will run about      
Client:,Deadbeats, great  but i ll have to pay in us dollars 
Me:,Deadbeats, not a problem  that should come out to roughly       
Client:,Deadbeats, what  no  i ll pay you      
Me:,Deadbeats, well  no  that s not the price i estimated  i mean  we can lower the cost by removing some options but 
Client:,Deadbeats, what are you talking about  that s the same price  
Me:,Deadbeats, so how would you like the site to look 
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t exactly know yet 
Me:,Deadbeats, what colors do you want me to use 
Client:,Deadbeats, red  blue and yellow 
Me:,Deadbeats, is there anything else you could tell me  anything to help me make you a that you will like 
Client:,Deadbeats, just make the whole site  and i ll say if i like it or not 
Me:,Deadbeats, i can t make a whole site based off of three colours on the off chance you ll like it 
Client:,Deadbeats, just do what i ve told you  then we can discuss how much your payment should be  
Client:,Deadbeats, why is my site still down 
Me:,Deadbeats, you still haven t paid  nor have you filled out the contract 
Client:,Deadbeats, what does this have to do with me  you are causing harm to my site 
Me:,Deadbeats, if you sign the paperwork and pay to renew your hosting  the site will be back up in a matter of minutes 
Client:,Deadbeats, i can t have a business relationship with someone that s causing harm to my business 
Me:,Deadbeats, i have 
Client:,Deadbeats, but how am i going to get my site back up 
Me:,Deadbeats, refer to the previous email re  payment and contract  see attached 
Client:,Deadbeats, hello there  we were referred to you and we would like you to rebrand this product for us  can you give us an estimate of how much that would cost 
Me:,Deadbeats, of course  if you just want me to redesign your logo  that would cost about       but if you want me to rebrand your entire product line  that would be in the range of            depending on how much work is required 
Client:,Deadbeats, okay  we have a deal  
Client:,Deadbeats, hello  can you do something like this with the logo  at the already agreed upon price  of course 
Client:,Deadbeats, we want custom designs for all of the signage of our campus buildings  both exterior and interior 
Me:,Deadbeats,  okay  that s a couple hundred designs  but we can definitely take care of that  right now  i can tell you we re looking at a few weeks to complete  i ll need a few days to figure out the details  work out a schedule  and then i ll send you over an estimate and a quote for the down payment 
Client:,Deadbeats, ah  yeah  we re not really  down payment  people 
Me:,Deadbeats, ah  i see  we re 
Client: ,Deadbeats,go on mom  ask her 
Client:,Deadbeats, that idiot is chasing us again  see below 
Me:,Deadbeats, it seems you replied to my last email rather than forwarding it on  just a heads up 
Client:,Deadbeats, now he s somehow reading our emails 
Me:,Deadbeats, why didn t you pay my invoice 
Client:,Deadbeats, it didn t feel right 
Client:,Deadbeats, i gave you direction  on the very first email  i said i wanted you to talk about certain issues 
Me:,Deadbeats, yes  but even after we asked for clarification about those issues  you never responded  we sent numerous emails and made numerous calls 
Client:,Deadbeats, you should have been able to figure it out 
Me:,Deadbeats, without the 
Client:,Deadbeats, i thought i would just pay you for the finished product 
Me:,Deadbeats, at this rate  there never will be a finished product  as per our original conversation  you must pay us at specific milestones  two of which have already passed 
Client:,Deadbeats, i need this asap  i know you said you don t work on the weekends but this is really urgent 
Me:,Deadbeats, alright then  i am going to send you 
Client:,Deadbeats, what  you said you didn t work at the weekend  i don t want to pay for stuff you do in your free time 
Client:,Deadbeats, why would i hire another designer when i could just get you to do it 
Me: ,Deadbeats,  i wasn t planning to work for free 
Client:,Deadbeats, i meant that i d get you to do this work in addition to the work i m already paying you for 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i d have to charge if the scope of the project gets bigger 
Client:,Deadbeats, you can t just spring something like that on me  
Client:,Deadbeats, why haven t you started on the project  we discussed this over month ago 
Me:,Deadbeats, i issued 
Client:,Deadbeats,  well  this is critical now  we need it for tomorrow morning 
Me:,Deadbeats, but as i outlined in my fee proposal  that s four days worth of work   i can t do that in a day 
Client:,Deadbeats, you will if you want to be paid   
Me:,Deadbeats, i d have to charge rush  
Client:,Deadbeats, you can t be serious  if it s only takes a day to do it  you won t charge for more than a day 
Me:,Deadbeats, so  because you ve left it late  you d like me to work through the night so i can do four days work in eighteen hours  and you d only like to pay me for eight of those hours 
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  if you want to keep working with us  i expect you to work to our deadlines and accept our payment terms 
Client:,Deadbeats, my previous flash developer  who lives in the states  can t be contacted  we got an email saying he was admitted to hospital  i ve got a  swf of what he d done for us 
Me:,Deadbeats, but you don t have the source files 
Me:,Deadbeats, well  you can recreate the source  fla from a  swf  but it s hard work  a lot of hard work  do you have a budget and a deadline 
Client:,Deadbeats, he got all the money  there s nothing left  the deadline s a week away  oh  and this is part one of eight similar modules  he might be dead  so you ll fix it for me  right 
Me:,Deadbeats, alright  the translation will be     euro 
Client:,Deadbeats, ok      euro 
Me:,Deadbeats, no      euro 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh i know  i m not trying to 
Client:,Deadbeats, i ll fax you a copy of the cheque 
Me:,Deadbeats, great  i ll fax you a copy of the goods 
Client:,Deadbeats, can you do this task for me 
Me:,Deadbeats, sure  that ll take about five hours 
Client:,Deadbeats, great  go at it then 
Me:,Deadbeats, here you are  it only took me three hours 
Client:,Deadbeats, that s great  i have this other requirement  can you change that 
Me:,Deadbeats, sure  that ll take about two hours 
Client:,Deadbeats, great  that works 
Me:,Deadbeats, here you are  it only took me an hour and a half 
Client:,Deadbeats, ah  we also need this other change 
Me:,Deadbeats, no problem  that should take another two hours 
Client:,Deadbeats, awesome 
Me:,Deadbeats, here you are  took me two hours and thirty minutes 
Client:,Deadbeats, great  that s exactly what i need 
Client:,Deadbeats, uh  i m surprised by this invoice  it s for seven hours  this is not what we agreed upon in the initial estimate 
Me:,Deadbeats, you asked for those additional changes 
Client:,Deadbeats, yeah  but i can t pay you that much  can we maybe talk about your rates 
Me:,Deadbeats, sorry  no  i stated my rates upfront and i don t give discounts 
Client:,Deadbeats, you re making this difficult for me  i ll tell you what  i pay you      of what you want to bill me and we call it quits  deal 
Me:,Deadbeats, no deal  you pay me for the time i worked at the rate i quoted  end of story 
Client:,Deadbeats, we re at an impasse here 
Me:,Deadbeats, i m sorry to have to decline further negotiations and work for you  other obligations from paying clients have popped up  please pay the invoice at your convenience  once it s paid in full  i ll send you the work i did for you 
Client:,Deadbeats, but i need this work  can t you send it to me now 
Client:,Deadbeats, you have high rates  you know 
Client:,Deadbeats, 
Client:,Deadbeats, please send me the work 
Client:,Deadbeats, hello 
Editor’s Note: ,Deadbeats,    of that invoice is even less than what was originally quoted  
Client: ,Deadbeats,i think it would save us both a lot of time and effort if i got the final files now and you just trusted me when i said the check for the full      was on its way 
Me:,Deadbeats, 
Client: ,Deadbeats,see  this is the sort of issue i didn t want the project to get hung up on  
Client:,Deadbeats, i ve 
Me:,Deadbeats, uh  i don t think i m the right person for the job  why would you want to hire me if you don t like my portfolio 
Client:,Deadbeats, well  i expect a discount since i m a hard sale 
Me:,Deadbeats, ah  
Client:,Deadbeats, we would like you to make a brochure insert for our dvd 
Me:,Deadbeats, sure  what colours  font  pictures and written content would you like 
Client:,Deadbeats, we don t know  we d just like it to be professional looking  just do what you think looks good 
Me:,Deadbeats, sure thing 
Client:,Deadbeats, thanks for your effort  but we d like to make some changes  we d like the font to be plain arial  remove the colours to just black and white  and remove all the pictures  we think they re too distracting 
Me:,Deadbeats, i wouldn t recommend that  you need at least some colour or pictures  otherwise it ll be boring and flat 
Client:,Deadbeats, just remove them  please  and we d like a copy so that we can show our ceo for approval 
Me:,Deadbeats,  shrug  sure 
Client:,Deadbeats, after much deliberation  we ve decided that we no longer require the brochure  and we d like to add that we are very disappointed in your design services  and we d like a refund on our deposit 
Me:,Deadbeats, oh  why is that 
Client:,Deadbeats, we found the brochure too boring and unprofessional  i mean  there aren t even any colours  
Client: ,Deadbeats,i have never come across 
Client:,Deadbeats, i want to make a new website on vistaprint  it doesn t take too long and we can meet this week to discuss 
Me:,Deadbeats, so you don t want the website i just finished for you 
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t think so  but don t do anything with it yet though  with vistaprint  i pay     a month  and it puts my website on google  yahoo  yellow pages  chrome  firefox  gmail  all that  it only takes one hour to make  i looked into it  plus  
Me:,Deadbeats, no problem john  how about i give you all the deposit back and call it quits  you can just use your friend s photos 
Client: ,Deadbeats,no  no  please   we just want a reduction in price  send us the high resolution files and we call it quits 
Me:,Deadbeats, please  john  i d prefer to give you all the money back 
Client: ,Deadbeats,i don t understand  my 
Me:,Deadbeats, john  i recall your best man s speech   especially the bit about you studying english at oxford  i know you understand me quite well  full refund  images deleted  it s the best way 
Client: ,Deadbeats,oh  okay  how much discount for the high resolution files then 
Me:,Deadbeats, no discount  i m spending valuable time talking to you right now  when i should be spending that time looking for new clients since i m out so much money 
Client: ,Deadbeats,no  no  i ll pay by cheque  is that okay 
Editor’s Note,Deadbeats,        rupees is about      
Me:,Deadbeats, hey  i m going to have to come around to your office tomorrow  
Client:,Deadbeats, oh  i figured the bank could just handle that 
Client:,Deadbeats, listen  you have a lot of competition out there  can t you just do this for       there s 
Me:,Deadbeats, i m sure my prices are fair  if you can find something cheaper and you trust their quality  you should go for it 
Client:,Deadbeats, but i can t find anyone to do it for less than       
Me:,Deadbeats, hey  this is the last email i m sending you  i logged into your google apps account and saw you deleted my last eight emails without reading them  i m taking down your site now that i know you saw the emails and you chose to ignore them  if i get payment before tomorrow night  i won t take it down 
Client:,Deadbeats, yeah  sorry man  you can actually take the site down  that was just temporary  i knew it wouldn t last long  anyway  i m going to be starting a new business next month  would you want to make the site  
Client: ,Deadbeats,we are prepared to pay you     th your quote  since the amount you are asking for is ridiculous  explain to me just how you think your services are worth that much  
Me: ,Deadbeats,well  that s according to you  for example  why do you charge     th what you re offering me  for what you re trying to sell 
Client: ,Deadbeats,i don t have to explain my prices to my customers  
Me: ,Deadbeats,exactly 
Me:,Deadbeats, 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh  i forgot to tell you that i asked another freelancer for the same thing and he did it too  so i m splitting the bill between you guys  you know  he s twice your age and you did a better job  i gave him your email and told him that 
Client: ,Deadbeats,oh yeah  i forgot about that  well  you used a program and cheated  
Me:,Deadbeats, alright  i ve looked over your business proposal  i agree that there is some editing to be done so that it appears more professional  here is an outline of the work i ll do  a timeline estimate  and a cost estimate 
Client:,Deadbeats, go ahead and do the work you outlined  the timeline estimation works for me as well 
Me:,Deadbeats, how about the price  do we officially agree on that number 
Me:,Deadbeats, i d like to have a full agreement in place before i get started  since we re doing this all through e mail 
Client:,Deadbeats, do the work  and then we ll discuss the price 
Me:,Deadbeats, would you like a two page sample to give you an idea of my work before we confirm the price 
Client:,Deadbeats, just do the work  get it back to me  i ll review it  and if it s what i want  then we can talk price 
Me:,Deadbeats, i think we might be having a bit of a communication problem  so let s be clear  you want me to do the work  send the edited copy back to you  and then we ll discuss and agree on the price 
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  that s how it works 
Me:,Deadbeats, i m a little uncomfortable with that  i don t mind if you pay me in installments  or half now half when complete  but it s a little too much to ask for me to finish the project before i have any guarantee that i ll be paid the amount i m asking  or any amount at all 
Client:,Deadbeats, well  you won t be paid if i don t like what you ve done 
Me:,Deadbeats, all i d be doing is editing for technical issues such as typos  grammar  sentence clarity  and suggesting any structural changes  it s a straight forward edit  which is why i d like to set a fixed price 
Client:,Deadbeats, i want to see the finished work before 
Me:,Deadbeats, i want to discuss payment before i start the project 
Client:,Deadbeats, hey  i got a fun project i need you take on this weekend  it d have to be free 
Me:,Deadbeats, that doesn t sound fun  that sounds like work 
Client:,Deadbeats, if it was work  
Client:,Deadbeats, i have a website  but the guy who made it turned out to be a bit rubbish  could you take a look at it and tell me what improvements it needs 
Client:,Deadbeats, can t you just add the changes to what s already there 
Me:,Deadbeats, i can t work with this  i make websites from scratch   i don t take on other people s code 
Client:,Deadbeats, i ve already paid for a new website  so 
Me:,Deadbeats, what is the budget you had in mind for the changes  maybe we could look at getting a new site made on that budget 
Client:,Deadbeats, like i said  i ve already paid  so i don t see why i should spend any more money at all  can t you just move things around a bit 
Me:,Deadbeats, not for free  no 
Client: ,Deadbeats,why not 
Client:,Deadbeats, please 
Me:,Deadbeats, i signed contract on rightsignature  but after reading it word for word  i cannot agree to work under the terms of your newest contract  you changed the payment terms to be  per project    i can only agree to hourly payment terms due to the shifting project requirements 
Client:,Deadbeats, oops  sorry  i sent you the contract i have with another developer  ignore it and we will work with the last contract we signed 
Me:,Deadbeats, the domain has expired  you will have to pay to renew it and then i will be able to transfer it to another registrant  
Client:,Deadbeats, nice try  but 
Client:,Deadbeats, you know  the budget was so tight that we lost some money producing this event  so now we don t have enough money to pay your fee  we ll take your fee as compensation for spearheading a project had us lose money  wish you well 
Client: ,Deadbeats,how come i have to pay so much 
Me:,Deadbeats, because i had to travel such an obscene distance to get to you 
Client:,Deadbeats, but this is a lot 
Me:,Deadbeats, i warned you beforehand that it was going to get this expensive 
Client:,Deadbeats, but i thought  because you re just starting out  you would ask a severely reduced price 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i explicitly told you how much i would ask for prior to doing so  
Client: ,Deadbeats,how was i supposed know you would stick to that 
Client: ,Deadbeats,yes  we like the logo  but we are not sure about it  we will think and compare it with ours 
Me: ,Deadbeats,ok  no problem  take your time and let me know  if you decide to use it  i ll send my invoice for the remaining balance alongside the  eps and a variety of high quality formats 
Client:,Deadbeats, could you send us the  eps and hd formats now  
Client:,Deadbeats, i know how easy it is to set this up  i used wordpress a couple of years ago  you just need to add a couple of plugins and copy my content  it takes no effort or skill  frankly  i think you should do it for free   
Me: ,Deadbeats,sorry  i can t go lower than my already reduced rate of     hour 
Client:,Deadbeats, can you at least come down to     hour 
Me:,Deadbeats, sorry      is as low as i can go 
Client: ,Deadbeats,fine  i ll do it myself 
Client:,Deadbeats, look  whatever  i ll pay your ridiculous rates  here s what i need  
Me:,Deadbeats, okay  great  i ll get started first thing on monday 
Client:,Deadbeats, 
Client:,Deadbeats, i want know 
Me:,Deadbeats, i m sorry ma am  did you say you received a bill for        
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  i can t believe you a  holes can charge that much 
Me:,Deadbeats, are you sure it s from us 
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  i have it right in front of me 
Me:,Deadbeats, okay  what s the date of service 
Client:,Deadbeats, the   th of last month 
Me:,Deadbeats, it looks like you only owe the remaining     from your bill  
Client:,Deadbeats, well someone fu  ed up  i m sitting here staring at a fu  ing bill for        
Me:,Deadbeats, okay ma am  calm down  are you sure the bill is from us 
Client:,Deadbeats, yes  i m sure you fu  ing idiot  it says right here oh where the f    is it  here  chase bank card member services 
Me:,Deadbeats, ma am  would that be your visa bill you re looking at 
Client:,Deadbeats, i m not a fan of any of these  the one with the pink is okay  but the pink itself is pretty lame 
Me: ,Deadbeats,there isn t any pink in my samples 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh  this is another designer s work 
Client:,Deadbeats, these are great  but  we need to 
Me: ,Deadbeats,what s the issue 
Client:,Deadbeats, well  i know at least one designer willing to work for less  
Client:,Deadbeats, would it be okay if i paid you in a month 
Me:,Deadbeats, that s fine  the invoice is has a    day pay period 
Client:,Deadbeats, great  that s when my kickstarter will be finished and i ll have money to blow 
Client:,Deadbeats, but you are also driving  so we should split the money 
Me:,Deadbeats, do you also say that to a taxi driver 
Client:  ,Deadbeats,but that s more than we pay our video editor  and that s someone with a real skill 
Client:,Deadbeats, i am not happy with your work  i 
Me:,Deadbeats, what did the other people quote you 
Client:,Deadbeats, i ll email it to you 
Me: ,Deadbeats,they quoted you twice my rate for half my work 
Client:,Deadbeats, which is unacceptable  we need to revisit your output 
Me:,Deadbeats, and my quote 
Client:,Deadbeats, exactly 
Me:,Deadbeats, looking at my schedule  i think i ll be able to start by the weekend and have the finished product by the   th 
Client:,Deadbeats, that s great  can you go ahead and write the contract up 
Me:,Deadbeats, i was able to get started a little early  if you look at 
Me:,Deadbeats, ok  i ll those in for you by the next draft 
Client: ,Deadbeats,i m going to need all these revisions done by tonight or else i m finding someone else to do the work  
Me:,Deadbeats, can i ask 
Client:,Deadbeats, i paid      for five last time  now you re charging me      for ten  if you re going to charge me more  you should have let me know 
Client:,Deadbeats, how can you 
Me:,Deadbeats, that was the     advance payment  as outlined in the contract  the remaining     of the payment is now due 
Client:,Deadbeats, you should have told me that the     advance was only a partial amount 
Client:,Deadbeats, 
Me:,Deadbeats, ok  i m looking at my copy  what s the problem 
Client:,Deadbeats, it doesn t include the payments i ve made 
Me:,Deadbeats, i don t see any record of payment being received here  when did you make the payment and how did you pay 
Client:,Deadbeats, i wrote a cheque this morning 
Me:,Deadbeats, that you haven t posted yet 
Client:,Deadbeats, exactly  so why isn t it on the invoice 
Client:,Deadbeats, hmm  looks alright  but could you try the logo a bit smaller and in the center 
Me:,Deadbeats, sure  like this 
Client:,Deadbeats, yeah no  that didn t look as good as i thought  change it back  and could you try the sidebar in darker purple 
Me:,Deadbeats, sure  like this 
Client:,Deadbeats, yeah like that  but now the content boxes look a bit bleak  could you make them stand out more 
Me:,Deadbeats, look  you approved the design  any changes are heaps easier to do in photoshop than on the actual site with code  what are we doing here 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh  sorry  i m used to working this way  by the way  i talked to our ad and he had some good points  i ll send them over  
Me:,Deadbeats, all right  like that 
Client:,Deadbeats, yeah that s good enough  i guess  but we decided to postpone the launch until after summer so just save it somewhere and we ll pick this up in august or something  i trust
Client:,Deadbeats, where s the project  we re running late 
Me: ,Deadbeats,it s not even thursday yet 
Client:,Deadbeats, em  i just got to china  and it s already thursday here  noon  to be more exact  which makes you late    em 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i m afraid we re already well outside what we agreed on as per our contract  and i would have to charge additional time if you want any more changes 
Client:,Deadbeats, 
Me: ,Deadbeats,i m sorry  but you ve already breached our contract several times and i ve been polite enough to ignore the penalties that come with doing so 
Client:,Deadbeats, i m in china  there s nothing you can do  
Me:,Deadbeats, i still have not received the deposit for your event tonight 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh  i ll get that to you next week 
Client:,Deadbeats, 
Me:,Deadbeats, do you give away houses 
Client: ,Deadbeats,but if you want a copy of the booklet for free  
Me:,Deadbeats, here s the new website wireframe  we wanted your approval before we transfer all your old content to the new site 
Client:,Deadbeats, i love it  you hit it spot on 
Me:,Deadbeats, great  i ll go ahead and start moving content 
Me:,Deadbeats, hey  haven t heard from you in a while  do you have those log in credentials i asked for  we re not able to log into your old site anymore and we need access to transfer the content over 
Client:,Deadbeats, i changed the passwords 
Me:,Deadbeats, what  why 
Client:,Deadbeats, i hated the new site you designed and wanted to stay with the one i have now  i d rather not continue work with you 
Client:,Deadbeats, help  i tried moving my old content to the new site and everything is broken now 
Me:,Deadbeats, i thought you hated that site 
Client:,Deadbeats, i changed my mind  how much to move everything over 
Me:,Deadbeats, does that include the designs you never paid me for 
Client:,Deadbeats, well obviously  
Client:,Deadbeats, i want to pay by credit card
Me:,Deadbeats, no worries  i process credit card payments through paypal  so can accept visa or mastercard
Client:,Deadbeats, excellent  here my amex number 
Client:,Deadbeats, i like them  how much do i owe you 
Me:,Deadbeats, well  for the business cards you owe  xxx xx and then for the design fee  you owe us about    minutes of work which is  x xx  it was less than      
Client:,Deadbeats, no  i designed it  not you 
Me:,Deadbeats, well  you supplied us with the logo  but we designed the card based off a color scheme similar to your corporate colors  we arranged the contact information  and we offer a copy of the illustrator file so you can avoid any sort of design fee in the future  prior to printing  i told you  
Client:,Deadbeats, don t tell me that you designed this card  i designed it  
Me:,Deadbeats, this invoice is 
Client:,Deadbeats, i understand  but things have been really slow around the shop lately 
Me:,Deadbeats, so you haven t been able to sell the product i provided to you  if not  i will stop by and pick up the unsold merchandise 
Client:,Deadbeats, i only have three or four pieces left in the store 
Me:,Deadbeats, but this means that you have sold the other    pieces 
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t see your point 
Me:,Deadbeats, if you have sold the garments  then you should be able to pay me what you owe me 
Client:,Deadbeats, i just don t have it  what if i placed another order 
Me:,Deadbeats,   
Me:,Deadbeats, i just need a credit card to complete the transaction 
Client:,Deadbeats, ok my number is            
Me:,Deadbeats, what s the country of the credit card 
Client:,Deadbeats, the what 
Me:,Deadbeats, what country is the credit card from 
Client:,Deadbeats, the what 
Me:,Deadbeats, what country do you live in 
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t understand 
Me:,Deadbeats, if you were to point on a map  where do you live 
Client:,Deadbeats,  long pause   from china
Me:,Deadbeats, so you live in china 
Client:,Deadbeats, no  what is where i am from 
Me:,Deadbeats, where do you live now 
Client:,Deadbeats, canada 
Me:,Deadbeats, okay then  the total is           can i process the payment 
Client:,Deadbeats, oh no  i didn t want to order anything  i just called for a price 
Me:,Deadbeats, wait  we agreed to the product and the price   why did you give me your credit card to charge you 
Client:,Deadbeats, because you asked me for it 
Me:,Deadbeats, in the future  that shouldn t be your only reason  
Me:,Deadbeats, you said the cheque was in the mail three weeks in a row and i have received nothing  if i don t receive anything in one week  i will be forced to take down your site 
Client:,Deadbeats, my site is down 
Me:,Deadbeats, i told you three times the site comes down 
Client:,Deadbeats, and i told you three times that the cheque is in the mail 
Me: ,Deadbeats,well i still haven t been paid despite you telling me that so many times  
Client:,Deadbeats, we don t think you ve delivered the quality of work that was in the reference video we sent you 
Me:,Deadbeats, well  sir  that s because the reference video had an        production cost  and 
Client:,Deadbeats, why would that make a difference 
Me:,Deadbeats, in accordance with the contract  you owe me x 
Client: ,Deadbeats,that s quite a lot of money  how about i don t tell anyone 
Me:,Deadbeats, i didn t sleep with any of your models 
Client:,Deadbeats, how about instead of payment  i organize that 
Client: ,Deadbeats,could you please send me the bill in the next view days 
Me,Deadbeats,  hi  i ve attached the bill 
Client: ,Deadbeats,hello  please note that i am currently on vacation and i won t be returning until january  nd  after january   th  i will no longer be working at this office  this is a automatic response your email will not be passed forward  merry christmas 
Client:,Deadbeats, looks like the contrast settings were out of whack on my monitor  
Me:,Deadbeats, happens to the best of us  
Client:,Deadbeats, exactly  anyways  let s revert all the changes you made  i expect all this 
Client:,Deadbeats, it s too bad  we were thinking of making you a preferred vendor 
Me:,Deadbeats, 
Client:,Deadbeats, it means we pay on time  
Me: ,Deadbeats,if you want a custom christmas e mail template  it ll take at least two billable hours  
Client: ,Deadbeats,we don t want to 
Me: ,Deadbeats,it s a bit more complicated than that  i m sorry  but i do have to charge by the hour  
Client: ,Deadbeats,no  why don t you spend a couple hours figuring out how we can do this for free 
Me: ,Deadbeats,you want me to sit here for a  couple hours  to figure out a way you can get me to work for a couple of hours for free  
Client:,Deadbeats, we need 
Me:,Deadbeats, it s been six months  i can take a credit card right now  or give me a fedex tracking number of the overnight check  otherwise the site goes offline  i m sorry it came to this 
Client:,Deadbeats, i can t get a check issued that quickly and i don t have a corporate credit card i can use 
Me:,Deadbeats, the only solution i can think of is having you pay the bill with your personal credit card on behalf of your company  and then you submit an expense report and get a reimbursement check from your company 
Client:,Deadbeats, i don t want to do that  do you have any idea how long my company takes to reimburse expenses  
Me:,Deadbeats, there  done  now just enter your card details 
Client:,Deadbeats, no  i don t trust the website 
Me:,Deadbeats, then you can t transfer your domain  don t worry  the site is very reputable 
Client:,Deadbeats, how on earth do you know  i m a businessman  i need to know who i m dealing with 
Me:,Deadbeats, they have an ssl certificate and half a million customers  i use these guys and i trust them with my card details 
Client:,Deadbeats, then we ll use your card details 
Me:,Deadbeats, but why would i pay for your site 
Client:,Deadbeats, i think 
Client:,Deadbeats, it must be difficult being a designer  like  if i were to ask you  right now  to design a logo for me  what would you do 
Me:,Deadbeats,  with a laugh  ask what you re willing to pay 
Client:,Deadbeats, haha  you re funny  but seriously  i d love to see how it works  
Client:,Deadbeats, now go  
Me:,Deadbeats, really  sorry  i 
Client:,Deadbeats, look  just tell me what you d draw  i want a logo that s professional and looks paid for 
Client,Deadbeats,  we like the design  but what s the blank box on the top 
Me,Deadbeats,  that s the space for the logo 
Client,Deadbeats,  then why is it empty now 
Me,Deadbeats,  because you haven t gave me the logo yet 
Client,Deadbeats,  oh  you know  you can 
Me:,Deadbeats, oh  well i usually charge about  
Client:,Deadbeats, you charge  
Client:,Deadbeats, yeah  you re just going to have to go ahead and use what we supplied 
Me:,Deadbeats, are you sure you don t have an  ai or  eps file of the logo kicking around 
Client:,Deadbeats, our old designer won t release the vector files
